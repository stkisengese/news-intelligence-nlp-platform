The ceremony was held in Qatar, which along with the US and the African Union, has been trying to mediate an end to decades of conflict in the resource-rich region. Earlier this year, the M23 captured the eastern region's main cities of Goma and Bukavu. Previous attempts to secure peace have failed. The US's Africa envoy Massad Boulos said the document covered eight protocols and that most still required work. He also acknowledged that prisoner exchanges and ceasefire monitoring had been slower than originally hoped. Kinshasa is demanding the withdrawal of Rwandan troops from its territory. Kigali says this can happen once the Congo-based FDLR rebel militia is disbanded. It is largely made up of ethnic Hutus linked to the 1994 Rwandan genocide. The new framework also addresses humanitarian access, the return of displaced people and protection of the judiciary, Boulous is quoted as saying by the AFP agency. It builds on a declaration of principles signed by the two sides in Doha in July, as well as a deal made in the same city last month on the monitoring of an eventual ceasefire. Before that, in June, talks between Rwanda and DR Congo brokered by Washington resulted in the signing of a peace deal that was hailed by US President Donald Trump as a \"a glorious triumph\" but wasswiftly violated by the warring parties. The M23 is one of the biggest parties in this conflict, but was not directly involved in the US-brokered ceasefire deal. It has always favoured the talks mediated by Qatar, saying they will address \"the root causes\" of the conflict. Decades of conflict escalated in January when M23 rebels seized control of large parts of eastern DR Congo including the regional capital, Goma, the city of Bukavu and two airports. Since January, thousands of people have been killed and hundreds of thousands of civilians forced from their homes. After the loss of territory, the government in Kinshasa had turned to the US for help, reportedly offering access to critical minerals in exchange for security guarantees. Eastern DR Congo is rich in coltan and other resources vital to the global electronics industries. Rwanda denies supporting the M23,despite overwhelming evidence, and insists its military presence in the region is a defensive measure against threats posed by armed groups like the FDLR.

Ten people, including a woman and a young girl, were killed when a ministry of religious endowments building in the eastern Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City was hit, according to rescuers. The Israeli military said it had struck \"Hamas terrorist targets\" after it said gunmen had opened fire towards an area where its soldiers were operating in the southern city of Khan Younis, in violation of the five-week-old ceasefire agreement. There was no immediate comment from Hamas. The flare-up of violence comes after the UN Security Council passed a resolution that endorsed US President Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan to end two years of devastating war. Mahmoud Bassal, a spokesman for Gaza's Hamas-run Civil Defence agency, told the BBC that Israeli air, drone and artillery strikes hit several locations in Gaza City and Khan Younis shortly after sunset on Wednesday. The attacks marked a sharp escalation after several days of relative calm, he said. The Civil Defence reported that the strike in Zeitoun caused severe damage to the religious endowments ministry's building and surrounding structures, and posted a video showing its rescue workers appearing to find two people buried under rubble. Photos published by the Anadolu news agency meanwhile showed the bodies of three young children reportedly recovered from the scene. In a separate incident in Gaza City, one person was killed and several others were wounded when a drone struck a group of people at Shejaiya junction on Salah al-Din Street, Gaza's main north-south road, according to Mr Bassal. He said another person was killed when a tank shell struck a house belonging to the Balboul family in Shejaiya's Mushtaha Street, which is also in eastern Gaza City. In Khan Younis, three people were killed and a number were wounded in a strike on a group inside a sports club run by the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa), he added. In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that \"several terrorists opened fire toward the area where IDF soldiers are operating in Khan Younis\" earlier on Wednesday. \"This action constitutes a violation of the ceasefire agreement. No IDF injuries were reported,\" it added. \"In response, the IDF began striking Hamas terrorist targets across the Gaza Strip.\" Israeli public broadcaster Kan cited a security source as saying the targets of the strikes were the commander of the Zeitoun Battalion of Hamas's military wing, the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, and the commander of its naval force. On Monday, the UN Security Council passed a resolution that sought to shore up the fragile ceasefire, which took effect on 10 October. Member states authorised the creation of a transitional governance body called the Board of Peace, which will be chaired by President Trump, and a temporary International Stabilisation Force (ISF), which will be tasked with ensuring \"the process of demilitarizing the Gaza Strip\". Trump hailed the resolution as \"a moment of true historic proportion\". A Hamas statement reiterated that the group would not give up its weapons without a Palestinian state, arguing its fight against Israel was legitimate \"resistance\". Israel's ambassador to the UN stressed the importance of disarmament, saying that his country would \"not stop or let up\" until Hamas no longer presented \"a threat\". The Israeli military launched an offensive in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. At least 69,500 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, including 280 during the ceasefire, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry."}

The move in the Republic of Ireland comes after the sale and supply of single-use vapesin Northern Ireland was banned back in April 2025. Anyone found guilty of stocking or supplying single-use vapes in Northern Ireland could face a maximum penalty of up to two years in prison and a fine of up to £5,000. In the Republic of Ireland, Health Minister Jennifer Carroll MacNeill received Irish cabinet approval to publish the Public Health (Single Use Vapes) Bill 2025, which would make it illegal for retailers to sell single-use e-cigarettes in the country. The Irish government also agreed to develop legislation preventing the sale of other nicotine products, such as nicotine pouches, to people under the age of 18. Advertising for such products will be banned in all retail outlets, and mixed retailers will no longer be allowed to display them openly. The measures will be incorporated into the Public Health (Tobacco Products and Nicotine Inhaling Products) (Amendment) Bill, which will regulate the packaging, appearance, flavours and display of nicotine-inhaling products. Officials said the framework is intended to apply to future nicotine products, as well as those currently on the market. Carroll MacNeill said the changes would help protect young people from \"developing a nicotine addiction\". \"My priority is the protection of our children,\" she said. \"The measures approved today will reduce the attractiveness and availability of current and future nicotine containing products for our young people. \"Taken together, these laws form a suite of measures to shield our children from the promotion and sale of these products and to allow them to grow up free from the risk of developing a nicotine addiction.\" Jennifer Murnane O'Connor, Minister of State at the Department of Health, said the proposals marked \"a big step forward\" in efforts to reduce nicotine use among young people. \"This is an ever-changing environment, and it is vital that we are ahead of the market when it comes to protecting our young people and safeguarding the health of future generations.\" Both ministers said they would work to implement the measures as quickly as possible."}

Instead, he did it solely for the \"magic\" of British Cycling. \"A way I can probably describe it is the Australian programme is like high school and the British programme is like Hogwarts,\" he says. Little more than a year ago, the 26-year-old track cyclist - a three-time Olympic medallist at last year's Games - sent shockwaves through the sport when he announced he waschanging allegiancefrom Australia to Great Britain, the country of his birth. The transition was tough at the start, landing on British soil at the start of 2025 when the weather was getting \"colder, greyer and darker\", but the sprinter quickly found his home at British Cycling's high-tech HQ. \"It's incredible with all this magic going on. It's a crazy place to be. I remember my first couple of weeks there and being like 'wow',\" he tells BBC Sport. \"People talk about no stones unturned and that's the definition of this place. I feel so fortunate to [have experienced] two completely different programmes, and I think having that is a real strength, applying two different mindsets or philosophies to try to find the fastest way to do things.\" It's a case of so far, so good for Richardson since the swap. In August he made history as the first cyclist to go under the nine-second barrier in the flying 200m, setting a new world record of 8.941 seconds in Konya, Turkey, before lowering that mark to 8.857 the next day. He is matter of fact about his achievement. \"It was a just a simple day,\" he says. \"I rocked up to the velodrome, did a warm-up, did a little bit of an activation and then rode faster than anybody else in history and that was basically it.\" Next up for Richardson and the rest of a 22-strong British squad is the World Championships in Santiago, Chile, from Wednesday. He has five world medals to his name but, as is the case at the Olympics, he has never won an individual gold at that level. Dutchman Harrie Lavreysen - a five-time Olympic champion and 16-time world champion - has always beaten him to the line. Asked if the switch to GB will aid him closing the gap on his \"biggest rival\", Richardson said: \"I think so. \"Based on my training times in the last year, I haven't got any slower. I have had everything at my fingertips to make me the best athlete I possibly can be. \"Has it made me a better cyclist? Yes. Has it given me a slight edge to where I was a year on? Yes. \"Whether that results in me beating Harrie, I don't know. \"I always go to win everything I compete in. I don't put this much effort in in training to come second. \"I do come second quite a lot, but it's not my main ambition. My ambition is to win absolutely everything.\" Emma Finucane won three medals at last year's Paris Olympics Joining Richardson in Chile is team-mate and girlfriend Emma Finucane, who in Paris became the first British woman since 1964 to win three medals at the same Olympics. The first of those was the women'steam sprint goldalongside Katy Marchant and Sophie Capewell, Britain's first in the event. After the Games and last year's Worlds, where she defended her individual sprint title and won team sprint gold, she flew to Perth, Australia, with Richardson for two months for a \"complete switch-off\". She swapped her bike for a surfboard and \"felt so present\", but by the time she came home she found herself missing cycling and was \"ready to go again\". Finucane will ride all three sprint events this week and is confident she can retain her individual rainbow jersey. The chaotic keirin is the only sprint event she has yet to win a major gold in, a target she maintains going into Santiago. In the team sprint, things are more uncertain. Marchant has recently had her second child, while Capewell has chosen not to compete this year. It means Finucane, at 22, will be the most experienced head on the team, riding alongside championship debutants Rhianna Parris-Smith and Iona Moir. \"Getting used to a new team is a new challenge,\" Finucane says. We get on well. The dynamic is different, but that's what's exciting, that we have that depth. \"There are about eight girls on the programme now, whereas a few years ago it was just Katy. That internal competition is how we won the Olympics. \"We have girls that can step up to a world-class level and will slot in. Just because Katy and Sophie are gone doesn't mean the team is any less good.\""}

The US tech giant was ridiculed after it revealed the iPhone Pocket on Tuesday would retail for £219.95, despite it being little more than a novel way to carry a mobile device. Many took aim at the high price online, while others made fun of its striking likeness to a piece of everyday knitted footwear -with one X user calling it\"$230 for a cut up sock\". And thepopular tech YouTuber Marques Brownlee saidit was a \"litmus test\" for fans who \"buy or defend anything Apple releases\". In a press release, Apple said the brightly-coloured accessory was part of a limited edition range created in collaboration with the Japanese fashion label Issey Miyake. The late fashion designer previously worked with the tech firm to create the black turtleneck jumpers famously worn by the company's co-founder Steve Jobs. Apple said the product had been inspired by \"a piece of cloth\", and its concept came from \"the idea of creating an additional pocket\". The bag's short strap design will be available in eight colours, and the long strap in three colours. The announcement drew criticism on social media, with many suggesting it showed Apple fans would \"pay for anything\". The bag's open top and sock-like structure also caught flak, with one X user saying: \"no zip, no structure and considering how many thefts of iPhones there are these days... no security?\" And some even posted tongue-in-cheek pictures of the actor Sasha Baron Cohen as the fictional character Borat, suggesting the product bore similarity to his bright green mankini. But others came to its defence, pointing out the price could be because of the collaboration with Issey Miyake, calling it \"a nod to the history of Apple\". Social media consultant and analyst Matt Navara told the BBC the price tag looked to be less about \"function\" but more about \"form, branding and exclusivity\". \"This kind of pricing is not new in the world of luxury fashion or designer collabs,\" he said. \"But for most consumers, it feels like Apple is testing the limits of brand loyalty.\" Sign up for our Tech Decoded newsletterto follow the world's top tech stories and trends.Outside the UK?

They're decked out in your favourite colours, are featuring your favourite music and the wording sounds like phrases you regularly use. Welcome to the future of advertising, which is already here thanks to AI. Traditionally advertisers on social media could target people by the demographic segment they were deemed to fit into - for example, if you're a student in Edinburgh or a 35-year-old woman who likes yoga. Ads would \"follow\" you around the internet based on what you'd been searching. But using the ability of AI to draw on vast quantities of data, companies like Cheil UK can create thousands of different ads that are tailored to different personalities and personal situations. The aim is to show countless different ads to millions of people, all unique to them, down to the tone, phrasing, music and colours used. To do that Cheil UK has been working with start-up Spotlight on an AI platform. To get extra layers of information they ask large language models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, lots of questions about a particular brand to find out what people are saying about it on the internet. From those answers they might, for example, be able to create an ad that not only suits a 35-year old woman who likes yoga, but also one that has just been on holiday or was about to get married. \"The shift is that we are moving away from what was collected data based on gender and age, and readily available information, to now, going more into a deeper emotional, psychological level,\" says Mr Camacho. \"That level is far deeper than it was previously, and that's when you start to build a picture to understand that individual.\" An added bonus for advertisers is that they might not even need a bespoke AI system to personalise their output. Researchers in the US studied the reactions of consumers who were advertised an iPhone, with tailored text written by ChatGPT based on how high that person scored on a list of four different personality attributes. The study found the personalised text was more persuasive than ads without personalised text - and people didn't mind that it had been written by AI. \"Right now, AI is really excelling on that targeting piece. Where it's still in nascent stages, is on that personalisation piece, where a brand is actually creating creative copy that matches some element of your psychological profile,\" explains Jacob Teeny, an assistant professor of marketing at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, who led the AI research. \"It still has some development to go, but all roads point to the fact that this will become the way [digital advertising is done],\" he adds. Personalised AI ads could also provide a solution to the problem of digital advertising 'wastage' - the fact that 15% of what brands spend on digital advertising goes unseen or unnoticed, so it generates no value to their business. Not everyone is convinced that personalisation is the right way to go. \"Congratulations - your AI just spent a fortune creating an ad only one person will ever see, and they've already forgotten it,\" says Brighton-based Alex Calder, chief consultant at AI innovation consultancy Jagged Edge, which is part of digital marketing company Anything is Possible. \"The real opportunity lies in using AI to deepen the relevance of powerful, mass-reach ideas, rather than fragmenting into one-to-one micro-ads that no one remembers. Creepy slop that brags about knowing your intimate details is still slop.\" Ivan Mato at brand consultancy Elmwood agrees. He is also questioning whether people will accept it, whether regulators will allow it, and whether brands should even want to operate this way. \"There's also the surveillance question. All of it depends on a data economy that many consumers are increasingly uncomfortable with,\" says London-based Mr Mato. \"AI opens new creative possibilities, but the real strategic question isn't whether brands can personalise everything - it's whether they should, and what they risk losing if they do.\" AI-personalised ads could also take a dark turn, Mr Camacho at Cheil UK acknowledges. \"There's going to be the camp that uses AI well and in an ethical manner, and then there's going to be those that use it to persuade, influence, and guide people down paths,\" he says. \"And that's the bit that I personally find quite scary. When you think about elections and political canvassing, and how the use of AI can influence voting decisions and who is going to be elected next. But Mr Camacho is committed to staying on the right side of ethics. \"We don't have to use AI to make ads creepy or to influence individuals to do things that are unethical. We're trying to stay on the nicer side of it. We're trying to enhance the connection between brands and individuals, and that's all we've ever tried to do.\""}

Over the years, handouts have taken different forms in the hotly contested political landscape of the world's largest democracy. Voters have been lured with everything from television sets tobicyclesand sometimes even gold ornaments - blurring the fine line between welfare economics and pre-poll populism. In recent years, cash transfers, especially directed towards women, have become a popular election-winning strategy for political parties of all stripes. A sweeping victory last week in the eastern state ofBihar- India's poorest state - for an alliance led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is being credited in part to a 10,000 rupee ($112; £85.18) cash handout to the state's women. A record number of women turned out to vote in the election. Similar women-oriented financial support schemes were launched by Modi's party in other states like Maharashtra ahead of polls last year. Opposition parties have also promised similar schemes in some states ahead of elections. Economists likeJean Drèzehave argued in favour of such giveaways. He says that while distinguishing between \"useful\" and \"wasteful\" handouts is important, it is only by extracting promises during elections that the poor in India get anything at all from their political representatives. On the other hand, despite his party's own track record on the issue, Modi has in the past warned of the dangers of \"revdi culture\" - likening election giveaways to the frivolous distribution of sweets. India's top court had also sought to curb the distribution of such \"irrational freebies\" during elections back in 2023. While there is broad agreement on the need for targeted subsidies to challenge the use of handouts as electoral bait, Indian elections are increasingly dominated by unaffordable, poll-driven freebie economics that states can ill afford. According to research from brokerage Emkay Global, Bihar is facing considerable fiscal pressure, with the deficit or gap between what the state earns and spends at 6% of its gross domestic product (GDP). Despite this, the state announced pre-election schemes amounting to 4% of GDP, more than its capital outlay - money that could have been spent in job-creating, long-term assets that would have aided the state's development. It is just one example in a litany of states practising indiscriminate election populism, according to Emkay Global. \"Even good [fiscally prudent] states are now in the grip of freebie economics,\" the brokerage said, as a result of which the 3% fiscal deficit to GDP ceiling that has been mandated for states, to curb non-budgeted spending, is now actually the floor. Some estimates suggest that 21 of India's 29 states havecrossedthis 3% deficit target, with disproportionate costs imposed by election-driven spending being one of the reasons. The fact that such populism is unsustainable is illustrated by the Bharatiya Janata Party-led alliance's Ladki Bahin (Beloved Sister) financial assistance scheme, which led to a 0.4% jump in Maharashtra state's deficit, according to Emkay Global. It forced the government to roll back some of the promises once the polls were over. India's central bank has also flagged the rising burden of such subsidies on state-level debt as a key emerging concern. According to theReserve Bank of India (RBI), while overall debt of Indian states declined to about 28.5% of GDP by March 2024 compared with the levels seen over the past decade, it remains well above the 20% recommended threshold, with new pressures emerging in the form of an increasing subsidy burden. \"An area of incipient stress is the sharp rise in expenditure on subsidies, driven by farm loan waivers, free/subsidised services (like electricity to agriculture and households, transport, gas cylinder) and cash transfers to farmers, youth and women,\" the RBI said in its 2024-25 report on state finances. \"States need to contain and rationalise their subsidy outgoes, so that such spending does not crowd out more productive expenditure.\" This warning comes as the private sector continues to hold back on investment in new job-creating factories, and the government, forced to slow its own capital spending on infrastructure, turns instead to tax cuts and giveaways to spur middle-class consumption. But with freebies seeing such success in Bihar - and more state elections looming - that warning is unlikely to be heeded. \"This [Bihar] election outcome reinforces the freebie wave that has swept states in the last two years, and with Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and crucially, West Bengal going to polls next year, one can expect this race to the bottom to continue,\" Emkay Global economists Medhavi Arora and Harshal Patel said in their note.

Under the new policy, women aged 18 to 52 working in government and private companies can take one day of menstrual leave every month, which cannot be carried forward. No medical certificate is required to avail the leave. The policy covers 350,000 to 400,000 women in the formal sector, although it excludes a much larger cohort - estimated to be six million - who are engaged as domestic workers, daily-wage labourers, and gig workers in the unorganised sector. Experts say the policy should extend to the informal sector. But the state's menstrual leave policy is still being regarded as significant for being the first to include the private sector, applying to workers regardless of job type or contract. The concept of menstrual leave is not new. Countries like Spain, Japan, South Korea and Indonesia already offer menstrual leave. Some Indian states also offer limited menstrual leave: Bihar and Odisha give two days per month to government employees, while Kerala provides it to university and industrial training institute staff. But in India, the move to give an extra day off to women sparks debate over potential gender bias and equality concerns. Others argue it's a necessary right, allowing women to avoid losing pay or working through unavoidable menstrual pain. \"This is one of the most progressive policy decisions for women that the government is implementing,'' Santosh Lad, Karnataka's labour minister, told the BBC. An official from Nasscom - a non-profit trade association of the IT and BPO industries - told the BBC that many companies in Karnataka already provide menstrual leave, so implementing the government order wouldn't be an issue. Pratibha R, president of the local Garment and Textile Workers' Union, welcomed the decision, noting that most female garment workers get barely 11 leave days a year. However, some women feel that the policy will be hard to implement. Menstruation remains taboo in many parts of India, with women often barred from temples or isolated at home as \"unclean\" during their periods. \"How can one go and seek menstrual leave when we don't even speak about it [menstruation]? Our society has not reached that level,'' Anunita Kundu, a manager at a software company, told the BBC. Aruna Papireddy, another IT worker, said: \"If you ask me, leave is not required. Women have reached high positions without even mentioning the M word.'' Pushpendra, a social scientist who goes by one name, says the real challenge is battling the deep-seated stigma around menstruation. \"If a woman seeks two days' leave in Bihar, it is understood that it is because of menstruation. It has facilitated women, but it has not empowered them.'' He notes that in many parts of India - including Bihar, which has offered menstrual leave for decades -  shopkeepers still wrap sanitary pads in old newspapers. Efforts to de-stigmatise menstruation in the past have included empathy exercises for men in the neighbouring state of Kerala. Yet in 2018, protests erupted in the state against lifting the ban on menstruating women from visiting Sabarimala temple, one of the holiest shrines in southern India. Some women in Karnataka say the government's menstrual leave policy could make people more comfortable discussing menstruation. \"Calling it menstrual leave helps in fighting the stigma,\" said Shreya Shree, a teacher based in Bengaluru city. Sapna S, an associate dean at Christ University and head of Karnataka's menstrual leave committee, urged women to take advantage of the policy. \"What is needed is an attack on the social conditioning that exists. Women should not be apologetic or shy to ask for menstrual leave,\" she said."}

The Proteas, who won the World Test Championship at Lord's in the summer, had trailed by 30 runs on first innings - but reversed that to pull off a 30-run victory as the hosts, needing only 124 to win, were bowled out for 93 in 35 overs. Veteran spinner Simon Harmer, 36, did the damage with four wickets in each innings for match figures of 8-51. India were a batter short in their second innings after captain Shubman Gill suffered a neck injury and retired hurt on day two. Gill remains in hospital for observation, with India having announced before play on Sunday that he would take no further part in the game. South Africa had begun day three on 93-7 in their second innings, a lead of only 63, but captain Temba Bavuma - the only batter to pass 40 in the entire match - forged his way to a defiant 55 not out from 136 balls. Aided by some big blows from Corbin Bosch (25), Bavuma shepherded the tail well to get them to 153 all out. Left-arm seamer Marco Jansen quickly had both openers Yashasvi Jaiswal and KL Rahul caught behind to leave India 1-2. Although Washington Sundar provided some resistance with 31 from 92 balls, he eventually fell to the part-time spin of Aiden Markram, while Harmer and fellow spinner Keshav Maharaj (2-37) ripped through the middle order as India lost their last five wickets in the space of eight overs. The second and final Test begins in Guwahati next Saturday, 22 November. Notifications, social media and more with BBC Sport"}

Anglia Ruskin University (ARU) has been awarded the government grant money and will use it to build new classrooms and digital media spaces at its Cambridge campus. Students on several computer games courses will benefit, and outreach courses for disadvantaged learners and short courses for those already employed in the industry will also be offered. The grant is from a bigger pot of cash that has been awarded to institutions nationwide, for projects that \"offer a boost to local and regional economies and promote national growth\", said theOffice for Students(OfS). ARU said its new facility would provide students with a more flexible working environment, \"reflecting the real-life collaboration between disciplines that would be found in a professional computer games studio\". The university currently offers a range of courses at undergraduate and postgraduate level, including in computer games design and art, and in games development. The new facility would allow it to double capacity and student enrolment in these subjects by the 2028 academic year, ARU said. According to arecent report by the trade association TIGA(The Independent Game Developers' Association), the computer games industry currently supported more than 73,000 jobs, including about 28,000 developers, and contributed £2.2bn in tax revenues. Prof Catherine Lee, ARU's pro vice chancellor, said: \"This new facility will further enhance the experience for students on our computer gaming courses, support lifelong learning, and contribute to national and regional skills priorities in the creative industries.\" OfS director of resources and finance, Nolan Smith, said: \"The projects we are supporting will make a tangible difference to current and future students. \"As well as expanding opportunities for students in strategically important subject areas, these projects will offer a boost to local and regional economies and promote national growth.\" Follow Cambridgeshire news onBBC Sounds,Facebook,InstagramandX."}

The prize for completing this feat is $1m (£760,000) and it only applies in the Riyadh Season Snooker Championship in Saudi Arabia. The concept of adding the golden ball in order to create the big-money 167 break was introduced at the Riyadh event in 2024, although no player was able to achieve the 167 break in either of its first two iterations. In the initial tournament, only the first player to do it would receive the $1m prize, although that has since been changed so that all players to achieve it will receive $1m. Pot the golden ball or win the Riyadh Season Championship? Before the tournament, which starts on Thursday,players have been debatingwhether they would rather win the tournament or achieve a 167 break. The prize money for winning in Riyadh is £250,000, less than a third of the prize money for a single 167 break. \"I think I'd rather get the big break to be honest with you,\" said seven-time world champion Ronnie O'Sullivan. \"I've won the tournament before and it's great to win the tournament, but to get the 167 I think would be amazing.\" John Higgins added: \"It would be a crazy sum of money to win, wouldn't it? Just for 10 minutes work. \"I'd rather get a 167. That will do me. It is the equivalent of winning three tournaments, isn't it? \"If you think about the World Championship and what it takes to win that, it's 17 days of torturous snooker to win that and half a million pounds. To actually do it in 10 or 12 minutes and win probably win the biggest prize in snooker, it would be crazy.\" Judd Trump said that he would still \"rather win the tournament\" itself than the payday for a single 167 break. \"I think that's probably the next step up [from the 147 maximum break],\" former player Shaun Murphy told BBC Sport. \"I think the 167 will go this week. The million-dollar bonus was a bit of a surprise for everyone last time round, but I think everyone's been gearing their practice around that this time and everyone's prepared for it. \"I've had a few days with nothing to do so I've been practising them myself, and I just think the 167, with everything it means out here, is probably the next step for snooker.\" O'Sullivan disagreed that a 167 would happen this week. \"I don't think anyone will do it, that's just my personal opinion,\" he added. \"I'd be happy to be wrong because if someone did it, it would be an amazing achievement.\" This article is the latest from BBC Sport'sAsk Me Anythingteam.

Six people took part in a 20-minute bidding battle for the Portrait of Elisabeth Lederer which was painted between 1914 and 1916. Auction house Sotheby's has not disclosed the buyer's identity. The portrait was looted by the Nazis and almost destroyed in a fire in World War Two, but was rescued in 1948. The artwork was returned to Lederer's brother, Erich, a friend and subject of Klimt's contemporary, Egon Schiele. The piece remained in Lederer's possession for most of his life, before he sold it in 1983, according to Sotheby's. The painting shows Lederer, an heiress and the daughter of one of Klimt's patrons, wearing a white robe and standing in front of a blue tapestry covered in Asian motifs. The Nazis, who annexed Austria in 1938, looted the Lederer art collection but left family portraits behind,says the National Gallery of Canada. Estée Lauder heir Leonard A Lauder made it part of his private collection in 1985, where it was displayed in his Fifth Avenue home in New York. Tuesday's sale shot past expectations, with the painting predicted to sell for  $150m before the auction. The second highest sale for a Klimt on record was Lady with a Fan, which sold for $108.8m in 2023 in London. Several other Klimt works in Lauder's collection were auctioned at the same event, including Flowering Meadow and Forest Slope at Unterach am Attersee, which fetched between $60m and $80m each. The most expensive artwork ever sold at auction was Salvator Mundi, attributed to  Leonardo da Vinci, which sold in 2017 for $450.3m. Tuesday also saw a sculpture of a fully functioning gold toilet by the conceptual artist Maurizio Cattelan picking up $12.1m just an hour after the record-breaking Klimt sale. The 101-kg toilet received just one bid. Sotheby's said that the buyer was a famous American brand."}

Bloodstains on the ground in el-Fasher have been photographed from space. The stain on the record of the international community is less visible, but no less damaging,\" UN human rights chief Volker Türk said at an emergency meeting in Geneva on Friday. Since the civil war began over two years ago, more than 150,000 people have been killed and about 12 million have been forced from their homes. The new investigation is mandated to identify those who ordered and carried out the massacre in el-Fasher. The findings could be shared with the International Criminal Court. While Türk did warn individuals and companies  \"fuelling and profiting\" from Sudan's war, there is disappointment that the mandate makes no mention of other countries sponsoring the conflict. The UAE is accused of shipping weapons to the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary group, while Iran has been accused of supplying some weapons to the Sudanese army. Plus, there is concern that the cash-strapped United Nations, already finding it hard to sustain its humanitarian work in Sudan, may not have the funds to mount a really credible inquiry. El-Fasher was captured last month by the RSF following an 18-month siege. It was the last city in Darfur held by the army and its allies. The RSF has been accused of targeting non-Arab groups in the city and elsewhere in Darfur - a claim it has denied. One gruesome feature of this conflict has been the huge volume of footage and photos of horrific atrocities - often seemingly filmed by the culprits themselves, and circulated online. Researchers say this digital evidence will be analysed in a bid to bring the perpetrators to justice. \"The people of Sudan, particularly now in el-Fasher, are facing a situation that I never saw before,\" says Mona Rishmawi, a member of the UN's fact-finding mission on Sudan who has seen the change first-hand over more than two decades. The scale of the suffering today in Darfur is greater than the Janjaweed militia's genocide in the same region 20 years ago, she told the BBC's Newsday programme. The RSF traces its origins back to the Janjaweed. Back then, Ms Rishmawi explained, attacks were mainly on villages but now paramilitaries are targeting whole cities and refugees camps housing hundreds of thousands of people. \"[There have been] devastating mass killings, rape and torture, disappearances, missing people - and this comes against the background of 18 months of siege and starvation,\" she said. A joint G7 statement earlier this week condemned surging violence in Sudan, saying the conflict between the army and the RSF had triggered \"the world's largest humanitarian crisis\". It follows the Trump administration's most vocal intervention to date in the Sudan civil war, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio at the G7 summit demanding international action to halt the supply of weapons to the RSF paramilitaries - plus strongly worded criticism for some nations. The US is one of the so-called \"Quad\" of countries working for an end to the crisis, together with the UAE, along with Egypt and Saudi Arabia who are allies of Sudan's military-led government. The bloc recently proposed a three-month humanitarian truce, followed by a permanent ceasefire and a nine-month transition to civilian rule. Rubio, in what was widely regarded as a reference to the UAE alleged backing of Sudan's rebels, said on Wednesday: \"We know who the parties are that are involved [in weapons supply]... That's why they're part of the Quad along with other countries involved.\" The UAE, which has long denied supporting the RSF, replied in a statement on Thursday saying it was alarmed by \"the heinous attacks against civilians by RSF forces in el-Fasher\" and accused the Sudanese army of \"starvation tactics, indiscriminate bombardment of populated areas, and the reported use of chemical weapons\". These are accusation the Sudanese army has previously rejected. A furious denial also came from the RSF, denouncing what it called \"all biased statements against them\" and attempts to scapegoat it in order to cover up the army's rejection of the truce. The RSF waited until it had captured el-Fasher before announcing that it was agreeing to the truce. Sudan's army says it objects to the UAE's presence in the Quad but will still consider the proposal. In the meantime, there has been no let-up in the fighting. Only a small fraction of the population has managed to flee el-Fasher, where massacres are said to have take taken place. Piles of bodies on the ground and blood-stained earthare visible from space in satellite imagery. Speaking on Friday, Türk said: \"There has been too much pretence and performance, and too little action\" from the international community in the face of Sudan's devastating civil war. \"It must stand up against these atrocities - a display of naked cruelty used to subjugate and control an entire population.\" The flow of weapons into Sudan during this war has been analysed by various experts. Amnesty International says it has found evidence of weapons manufactured in Serbia, Russia, China, Turkey, Yemen and UAE being used in Sudan. The smuggling route is often via the UAE, through to Chad, then into Darfur -according to a leaked report by UN experts. The UAE in particular is accused of providing arms and support to the RSF, who in turn are accused of using the UAE as a marketplace for illicit gold sales. On Wednesday, Rubio pointedly said assistance to the RSF \"isn't just coming from some country that's paying for it - it's also coming from countries that are allowing their territory to be used to ship it and transport it\". He also said he did not want to \"diminish\" the involvement of other actors in the conflict, saying \"that includes potentially the Iranians, at least money and weapons being flown into the other side\", meaning to the Sudanese army. All parties deny these allegations. A fortnight ago, the UK government came under fire from its own lawmakers following allegations that British-made weapons were ending up in the hands of the RSF, who were using them to commit atrocities. In response to one MP's demand to \"end all arms shipments to the UAE until it is proved that the UAE is not arming the RSF\", Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said at the time: \"The UK has extremely strong controls on arms exports, including to prevent any diversion. We will continue to take that immensely seriously.\" There has been a UN arms embargo on the RSF's stronghold of Darfur since 2004, but it has not been extended to the rest of the country despite calls from human rights groups.

Lee Claydon, 45, from Bournemouth and known to his family by his middle name Clive, fell from an upper level at the end of the show on 2 August. At Barnet Coroner's Court, Det Sgt James Raffin, of the Metropolitan Police, told the hearing it was no longer being treated as a criminal case. \"We do not suspect any third party involvement,\" he said. \"This, from everything we have seen, was a tragic accident.\" Mr Claydon had been drinking but a toxicology report revealed \"no concerns\", the officer told the court. He said the force had also ruled out the possibility of suicide. Det Sgt Raffin added: \"From a police point of view, I would say our investigation is complete.\" The officer said he was aware the family had concerns over the \"circumstances on the night\" and that he would pass these on to officials at Brent Council. The father of three was pronounced dead at a Wembley medical centre at 22:38 BST, an initial hearing in September was told. The preliminary cause of death was given as \"multiple bodily injuries\". The fall happened during a run of stadium shows for the rock band's sell-out Live '25 reunion tour - their first since splitting in 2009. Oasis previously said in a statement: \"We are shocked and saddened to hear of the tragic death of a fan at the show.\" Mr Claydon's father, Clive, paid a tribute to his son, describing him as a \"lovely bloke\" and a \"hard-working family man\".

A crowd runs in panic along a dusty street. Shots ring out. A woman wearing a purple jacket carrying a stick falls to the ground. Another woman can be heard pleading, \"Mama, mama, stand,\" as she tries to lift her. Blood is spreading around her stomach as another stain appears on her back. This verified footage, filmed in Tanzania's city of Arusha, is just one of many graphic scenes to have emerged showing the violent actions of police as they attempted to crush widespread protests last month during the country's presidential and parliamentary elections. The protests started in the city of Dar es Salaam on 29 October and spread across the country over the following days. The demonstrations had largely been organised by young people left angry at what they see as a political system dominated by one party since Tanzania gained independence in the 1960s. Several opposition leaders were arrested and others banned from standing during the elections while a number of opposition activists were detained. Incumbent President Samia Suluhu Hassan ultimately secured victory after the electoral commission declared she received 98% of the vote. Since then the UN human rights office (OHCHR) said it had reports indicating that hundreds of people were killed during the protests, with many more injured or detained. A diplomatic source in Tanzania told the BBC there was credible evidence that at least 500 people had died. President Samia has called for anofficial investigationinto the unrest and asked prosecutors to \"show leniency\" towards those arrested. Footage of the protests was suppressed for almost a week when the government imposed a near-total internet blackout and threatened to jail anyone caught sharing any videos from the protests, saying it could cause unrest. Only once the block was lifted on 4 November did dozens of videos begin to emerge online showing violent scenes: uniformed officers appearing to fire at crowds, bodies lying on the streets, with others piled up outside a hospital. To understand what happened, BBC Verify has analysed, geolocated and confirmed footage, building a clearer picture of how police responded to the demonstrations. In the footage our team has verified the protests appear to have been dominated by groups of young men, drawing strong parallels with a global Gen-Z youth movement frustrated at economic decline and entrenched leadership in countries across Africa. The first demonstrations we identified took place early on election day in Dar es Salaam, the country's largest city and economic hub. They spread to other urban areas across the country, including the cities of Mwanza and Arusha. The internet blackout makes it difficult to establish a clear sequence of events, but what is clear from videos and images posted online is that protesters were confronted by heavily armed police units blocking their progress and firing tear gas to disperse crowds. In many of the videos, gunfire can clearly be heard as people scatter in the ensuing chaos. A key flashpoint was along the Morogoro Road, a main highway through Dar es Salaam. In two separate highly graphic videos, two bodies can be seen lying on the side road next to St Andrew's Anglican Church. One lies unresponsive, with heavy wounds visible on their head, surrounded by a pool of blood. We identified more bodies lying nearby around the same stretch of road: one next to a bus stop and two more on the ground surrounded by blood. One body is later seen wrapped in a white shroud. Further casualties are also visible along this stretch of highway and in the neighbouring side streets. Footage from another location close to the Open University of Tanzania shows a motionless body on the ground with an open head wound. In a later video taken from the same scene we see the body covered in a cloth and carried towards a group of policemen standing by the university building. \"Killers, killers,\" the group chants at the officers, one of whom is armed with a rifle, another carries a pistol. The body is then placed in the back of a truck. BBC Verify has confirmed at least a dozen other videos from Dar es Salaam showing people with a range of injuries, some of whom are being carried away. We have also documented casualties from protests more than 700 miles (1125km) away in Tanzania's second-largest city, Mwanza, that took place on election day. Within the grounds of the city's Sekou Toure Hospital, several videos show a pile of 10 bodies, all of whom appear to be young men. Some of them have visible open wounds. Other footage from within the hospital shows bodies laid out in what appears to be a hospital morgue. We have verified multiple videos of police shooting towards groups of protesters. In three videos posted online, police vehicles are seen chasing dozens of people as the attempt to flee along Nelson Mandela Road in Dar es Salaam. Several rounds of gunfire can be heard as the police advance. In Arusha, footage shows a police vehicle passing a crowd of chanting youths. Gunshots ring out and people are seen scattering and running for safety. Another video taken shows an injured man with those around him saying he's been shot. In the northern Kijitonyama area of Dar es Salaam, two men in uniform were filmed taking aim and firing along a main road in the direction of protests. We have confirmed the location next to a local school. The green uniforms and flat-topped peak caps worn by the two men closely match those worn by the Tanzanian police. Less than 100 metres away a man is shown lying on the street with a bloody head wound. In the distance, men wearing similar green uniforms can be seen. Someone shouts: \"He has been shot in the head. They have killed [him].\" As the video continues, more gunshots can be heard. There are also multiple videos seen by BBC Verify of men in the same green uniforms firing weapons - sometimes into the air, sometimes along open streets. Investigators from audio forensics experts, Earshot, said what can be heard in those videos confirms live rounds were used on protesters. After analysing the audio from the scene, they said: \"Rubber bullets typically do not travel at supersonic speeds. \"The presence of these shockwaves therefore indicates the use of live rounds.\" Not all the people we've seen carrying guns are wearing uniforms. In footage filmed in Sam Nujoma Road, Dar es Salaam, three men in civilian clothing are seen firing guns by a saloon car. It's unclear who they are. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, has called for an investigation into the killings and other violations committed during Tanzania's elections, and for the unconditional release of all those arrested before the vote took place and others who have since been detained. The Tanzanian government and police have been contacted for comment. What do you want BBC Verify to investigate?"}

Includedin the plan is the establishment of an International Stabilisation Force (ISF), to which, the US says, multiple unnamed countries have offered to contribute. The resolution was backed by 13 countries - including the UK, France and Somalia - with none voting against the proposal. Russia and China abstained. Adopting it was an \"important step in the consolidation of the ceasefire\", a spokesperson for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said. Hamas has rejected the resolution, saying it fails to meet Palestinians' rights and demands. The Palestinian armed group wrote on Telegram after the resolution passed that the plan \"imposes an international guardianship mechanism on the Gaza Strip, which our people and their factions reject\". \"Assigning the international force with tasks and roles inside the Gaza Strip, including disarming the resistance, strips it of its neutrality, and turns it into a party to the conflict in favour of the occupation,\" it added. Under the resolution, the ISF will work with Israel and Egypt, along with a newly trained and vetted Palestinian police force, to help secure border areas and ensure the process of permanently disarming non-state armed groups, including Hamas. Until now, the police there have operated under the authority of Hamas. Mike Waltz, the US's ambassador to the UN, told the council that the ISF would be \"tasked with securing the area, supporting the demilitarisation of Gaza, dismantling the terrorist infrastructure, removing weapons, and ensuring the safety of Palestinian civilians\". The Security Council also approved the creation of a transitional governance body called the Board of Peace (BoP), which would supervise governance of a Palestinian technocratic, apolitical committee and oversee the reconstruction of Gaza and the delivery of humanitarian aid. Financing for reconstruction of Gaza following two years of war would come from a trust fund backed by the World Bank, according to the resolution. Under the resolution, both the ISF and the BoP would work alongside a Palestinian committee and police force. Trump called the Security Council vote \"historic\" and said it was a way of \"acknowledging and endorsing\" the BoP, with its final membership to be announced soon. He is expected to chair the board. \"This will go down as one of the biggest approvals in the History of the United Nations, will lead to further Peace all over the World, and is a moment of true Historic proportion!\" he wrote on his Truth Social platform. Unlike earlier drafts, the resolution references a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood. It is language several council members pushed for. Israel strongly opposes the creation of a Palestinian state - a significant hurdle in the path to future statehood. Key Arab states had pressured drafters of the resolution to include Palestinian self-determination in the text. The UN secretary general's spokesperson stressed that the resolution needed to \"translate... into concrete and urgently needed steps on the ground\" and lead to \"a political process for the achievement of the two-state solution\". The US, the Palestinian Authority, and several Arab and Muslim-majority nations including Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Turkey have called for the quick adoption of the resolution. The Palestinian Authority (PA) said in a statement that the resolution's terms needed to be implemented \"urgently and immediately\". Russia and China did not exercise the vetoes they possess, but abstained to allow the resolution to pass, largely because the PA and eight other Arab and Muslim nations backed it. Both Moscow and Beijing criticised the resolution. They said there was little clarity about the key mechanisms' composition, that it did not ensure the participation of the UN, and that it failed to explicitly reiterate a firm commitment to the two-state solution. The initial phase of the plan - a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and the handing over of hostages and detainees - came into force on 10 October. Waltz described it as a \"fragile, fragile first step\". Trump's peace plan in effect suspended the fighting between Israel and Hamas that had raged since Hamas-led gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October 2023. About 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage in that attack. More than 69,483 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli military action in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry."}

But in a world order which challenges Washington's dominance, and under an administration which is stretching many of its ties, Australia is casting a more critical eye on the relationship. \"The Trump administration is clearly fraying some of those long-held, unexamined beliefs about the reliability of the United States as an ally,\" Sam Roggeveen, from Australia's Lowy Institute think tank, told the BBC. Trump's first term was a challenge for Australia – and few here expected his second would be much different. An election campaign earlier this year was in many ways hijacked by the question of how each prospective prime minister would deal with the president. Trump has frustrated Australia with his sweeping tariffs scheme, imposing an import tax of 10% on most of its goods - 50% for aluminium and steel - something seen as a breach of a decades-long free trade agreement. \"This is not the act of a friend,\" Albanese said at the time. Then came a review of the landmark Aukus defence pact, announced in June to jolts of panic in Canberra. Outwardly, the Albanese government didn't waver in professing its confidence that the agreement - which will give Australia cutting-edge nuclear submarine technology in exchange for help countering China in the Asia-Pacific - would go ahead. It is natural for a new government to review their predecessor's decisions, it said. But the White House's isolationist rhetoric - along with the fact that the US is facing challenges in its own submarine supply - made some nervous that the deal may be cancelled or rewritten, threatening to leave Australia vulnerable with trouble brewing on its doorstep. And then there was Albanese's long battle to secure a meeting with Trump – interpreted by parts of the Australian parliament and the country's media as a snub. An awkward encounter between Defence Minister Richard Marles and his US counterpart Pete Hegseth earlier this year didn't help. Marles had met Hegseth in August to lobby him on Aukus, but the latter's office issued - and later retracted - a statement saying there were no talks, only \"a happenstance encounter\". Ultimately the meeting on Monday went as well as it possibly could have for Albanese. He leaves the White House with both Trump's praise and a deal promising US investment in developingAustralia's critical minerals industry, which is hoped will help the nation break China's near monopoly of that market. Albanese also got a renewed commitment to Aukus, in effect ending the dragged-out review. He didn't receive a public dressing down – though Kevin Rudd, a former prime minister who was critical of Trump before taking up his current post as ambassador to the US, was awkwardly confronted with the president telling him \"I don't like you either\". The tariffs remain a gripe but are at the lowest rate of any country, and in fact some Australian sectors, like beef, appear to be benefitting from the global upheaval. And though the Aukus review was a scare it was ultimately a false alarm. But all of this and other factors, such as Trump's unpredictable treatment of other allies, has fuelled increased distrust of the US. \"For the first time in my lifetime, one of our two major political parties benefited in the last election from slightly distancing itself from the US,\" Mr Roggeveen said of Albanese. The numbers vary, but polling has consistently showed Trump is unpopular here, and fewer Australians believe America is a reliable ally under his leadership. And yet the latest poll found that, nevertheless, about half of Australians think the nation needs its alliance with the US more than ever. \"It's one thing to say Donald Trump is difficult, Donald Trump is unpopular. It's another thing to come up with an alternative to the US right now,\" the United States Studies Centre's Jared Mondschein told the BBC. \"That's really due to Xi Jinping. In many ways, he's the gift that keeps on giving for the US in Asia.\" Ahead of the meeting in Washington on Monday,a run-in between jets from the Chinese and Australian militariesserved as a reminder of tensions in the region. Beijing, which is Australia's biggest trading partner, has embarked on a huge military build-up and it's making Canberra, and a whole host of others, nervous. Mr Roggeveen says there is a belief amongst Australia's political and security experts that the country cannot defend itself independently, if it comes to that - though he is among a small cohort which disagrees. Many point to Pacific nations as a critical line of defence -something reflected in Australia's keenness to lock as many as possible into alliances- while a few voices argue China is in fact a potential security partner, not a threat. \"But there's a view... that the only reasonable course for Australia is to seek closer and closer relations with the United States,\" Mr Roggeveen says. \"A lot of allies and partners throughout the region are grabbing for the uncertainty of a term-limited Trump administration over the certainty of a Xi Jinping-led China,\" Mr Mondschein adds. So while the way Australians feel about the US is changing, it is hard to see it greatly straying from the path it is on any time soon."}

Lood de Jager was handed a four-game suspension afterbeing sent off for a high tackleon France full-back Thomas Ramos in Paris, while Franco Mostert was given a straight red card for a shoulder-to-head challengeon Italy's Paolo Garbisiin Turin last weekend. Mostert faces a World Rugby disciplinary hearing this week, with Stick confirming the world champions have appealed against De Jager's ban. \"Every week we are losing players and it's sad,\" Stick told reporters in Dublin before South Africa's Test against Ireland on Saturday. He added: \"I don't want to say things and then end up also being banned like Rassie [Erasmus, head coach] in the past. \"We've never talked bad about other teams. We always try and play in a good spirit, and hopefully things can just be between the four lines. Are we treated fairly? I don't think so.\" Stick also referenced recent bans for South Africa internationals Makazole Mapimpi and Jan-Hendrik Wessels while playing for Sharks and Bulls in the United Rugby Championship. Winger Mapimpi received a five-week ban for a dangerous tackle on Ulster's Michael Lowry on 18 October, while front-rower Wessels is serving an eight-game suspension - reduced from nine - for an alleged genital grab on Connacht's Josh Murphy. \"If you look at the past four red cards with our players - we had Makazole Mapimpi suspended, who is not on tour at the moment,\" said Stick. \"The guy is on 47 Test matches, missed out on a tour to make it to the 50th. Jan-Hendrik Wessels, a youngster, also missed out. Suspended. \"Lood de Jager, which I feel after this weekend and everything that I've seen, even the Fiji and the France game, the clean-outs that were there, the Ireland game against Australia, situations that were even worse than what those guys have been suspended for. \"Then for them they're suspended, but other players will come back and play this week. Surely somewhere somehow, this is not fair. \"I don't think we deserve this as a team.

I don't understand how does that become permanent red card. \"From our side as coaches, we still have to work hard because we're working with these guys. We can see that they're nice and tall. They try to do everything by the book, but because rugby is a physical game, sometimes you don't get it perfect. \"For them to say the tackle was 'never legal', it's disappointing.\" Stick also claimed the majority of the decisions against Italy did not go South Africa's way. \"Probably about 21 decisions that were supposed to be made in the first half or probably the first 45 minutes, 20 of them went against us. \"Not because of the ref. Unfortunately he has to respect the comms from his team outside. \"Disappointed with it, but once again, I feel for Italy and I would like to apologise with how things turned out, because they've got a good coaching staff and then their players were also up for the game, but for other things to happen like that, I don't think they deserve what they've got in that game.\" Rob Herring: Patience, pride and that Grand Slam try"}

They are never more than two-and-a-half years from a potentially generation-defining duel with Australia. While a home Ashes series is huge, winning in Australia is the holy grail. Perhaps it is no surprise then England have spent the past four years remodelling their pace attack with the express intention of triumphing in Australia for the first time since 2010-11. Gone are the more traditional English-style swing and seam bowlers, in their place a battery of hulking quicks capable of clocking 90mph. \"Pace is more important than wickets,\" was the message from England men's managing director Rob Key to bowlers hoping to force their way into the Test squad at the start of last summer. They have no shortage of pace now, and whatever happens over the next couple of months, England cannot be accused of turning up with a succession of right-arm medium-fast bowlers as they have in recent Ashes tours... The key battles - where the Ashes will be won and lost Who are TMS pundits' Ashes players to watch? The final frontier: Why has Root never made a century down under? 'The first hour in Perth will be really special' - Vaughan looks ahead to Ashes series The move towards an attack more suited for Australian conditions began following the appointments of Key, Brendon McCullum and Ben Stokes in the spring of 2022. Their first move was to bring back James Anderson and Stuart Broad, aged 39 and 35 at the time, after they had been dropped for England's previous Test series in the Caribbean. For all their many qualities, neither was known for their express pace and, three-and-a-half years on, England's two leading wicket-takers have both retired from international cricket. It means a seam attack shorn of 1,308 Test wickets, with the shoulder injury that prompted Chris Woakes' international retirement taking away another 192. As such, Stokes' men are down under with their least experienced bowling unit since that famous triumph in 2010-11. Stokes is the most experienced with 115 Test caps, Mark Wood has been playing Tests for 10 years but injuries have limited him to just 37 matches and, similarly, six years on from his dazzling debut at Lord's, Jofra Archer has featured in only 15 Tests. Yet it is Wood, who last played a Test in August 2024, and Archer, just two Test appearances since 2021, who will be tasked with spearheading the England attack. Gus Atkinson has perhaps been the biggest find of the post-Broad and Anderson era, with the Surrey quick taking 63 wickets at 22.01 in his first 13 Tests. Burly South African-born seamer Brydon Carse has also impressed, particularly away from home, while Josh Tongue has shown a handy knack for taking wickets, albeit not always with the control to match. Durham's Matthew Potts is also back in the mix almost a year after his last Test. Like Archer, this will be a first taste of an away Ashes series for that quartet. But England know all too well that experience alone does not win Tests in Australia. They're hoping pace and potency does. 'He nearly took my head off!' - Jamie Smith and Josh Tongue on Mark Wood's return To try and find that winning formula, England have used 15 seamers since the Stokes-McCullum era began. Of the five fast bowlers included in the squad for the first Test, only Stokes featured in that first series against New Zealand. Across those three matches, the combined average pace of England's seamers was 81.6mph. In the 12 series since for which CricViz has data available, that number has generally trended upwards, with England setting a new high of 83.8mph at home to India in the summer. You can expect that to increase further given Wood, 35, was absent in that India series. Wood is undoubtedly England's quickest bowler and, under Bazball, his skiwest average speed across a series is 88.6mph in the 2023 Ashes, with 90.4mph against West Indies a year later his highest. While keeping Wood fit is crucial, should he miss a match through injury or be rested, unlike England's last trip to Australia, he should not be the only touring bowler capable of rushing the home batters. Archer, Carse and Atkinson can all touch 90mphm while a fully fit Stokes was regularly bowling upwards of 85mph over the summer. It bodes well. 'Rapid' Wood bowls in nets to boost Test hopes In recent years surfaces prepared in Australia have been the fastest, most bouncy and among the most inconsistent in the world. Pace is undoubtedly one way to exploit that - as Australia left-armer Mitchell Starc has proven for years. A high release point is another, with Josh Hazlewood a fine example for the hosts, while Steven Finn and Chris Tremlett fulfilled that criteria for England on their last successful visit to Australia 15 years ago. Broad and Ollie Robinson fall into that category, too, and enjoyed more success than you might remember in the 2021-22 series - averaging 26.3 and 25.54, respectively. Of the current crop, Carse and Tongue stand out in that regard, while Atkinson and Archer both have high actions. Add in the angle Stokes' action creates and the skiddy nature of Wood and, in theory, England have strong variety despite the lack of a left-arm option. What England need to be careful of, though, is getting carried away with the pace and bounce and bowling too short. Last winter, the average ball bowled by Australia's seamers against India pitched 7.29m away from the stumps and while leading wicket-taker Pat Cummins averaged 7.55m, that was still fuller than all except Atkinson (7.39m) of England's travelling quicks in their most recent home series. With a bit of nip off the surface and theKookaburra balls doing morethan in years gone by, it might make sense to bowl a touch fuller. Australia can look at their own - slightly depleted - battery of fast bowlers and point out they have all those capabilities as well. But it is new territory for England to arrive with a group capable of matching - or even outdoing - the hosts for velocity. And it has been years in the planning. All roads lead to the Ashes and, having picked up the pace along the way, England have six weeks to reach their desired destination before a new journey begins.

In September,a BBC investigationexposed a black market selling thousands of Premier League tickets at two to four times the face value. While the new rules will make it illegal to resell tickets for sports events above the original cost, they will not cover football matches. Football ticket sales in the UK are covered by existing legislation. The 1994 Criminal Justice and Public Order Act made it an offence to offer for sale tickets to a football match other than by the organisers of the game. Only clubs, or organisers, are able to resell tickets on their own platforms if, for instance, season ticket holders are unable to attend. The Act was designed to cover anti-social behaviour, and with regard to football was intended to reduce the risk of violence and disorder at matches. This means football will not be part of the proposed new legislation on ticket sales. However, the Act applies only to tickets sold in England and Wales. The Premier League's \"unauthorised\" list of ticket sellers contains more than 50 websites including Stubhub and Vivid Seats,where Chelsea owner Todd Boehly is a director and investor. The companies operating the black market resales are registered in countries such as Spain, Dubai, Germany and Estonia. They are able to freely do this because the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act only applies to a ticket resale occurring within England and Wales - so they are untouchable. BBC Sport looked at four sites on the list which listed tens of thousands of Premier League tickets. For example, more than 18,000 tickets were advertised for Arsenal v Nottingham Forest alone - nearly a third of the Emirates' capacity. As part of the investigation we were able to buy tickets easily through the black market for four games. Prices ranged from £55 to £14,962, often far exceeding face value and usually including a significant booking fee. All our tickets were transferred digitally, in one instance on the morning of the game, and worked as mobile passes. The practice has been described as \"endemic\" in English football, but it's not going to be stopped. Premier League ticket black market exposed Key questions answered about football's black market for tickets Wimbledon has secured an exemption for its debenture tickets, which provide a premium seat on the show courts for five years along with access to exclusive restaurants and bars. There are 3,770 seats which can be bought and sold via a trading platform or privately. This could be positive news for Manchester United, who are consideringselling seat licencesto finance their proposed new £2bn stadium. Seat licences see fans pay a certain amount of money over an extended period of time to give them the right to buy the same seat as a season ticket, and potentially sell it on. While United's system would not be exactly like Wimbledon's debentures, the price cap in the new legislation isn't designed to threaten development of the UK's live events venues. In specific cases, venues should still be able to generate secure, up-front revenue that can be re-invested - such as through seat licences.

He was seen among around 60 men clad in black, who held up a banner that said \"Abolish the Jewish lobby\", Australian media report. Australia has seen a recent rise in right-wing extremism. Its government made the Nazi salute punishable by a mandatory prison term earlier this year. Australia's Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said Mr Gruter's visa had been cancelled on character grounds, adding that those who attended the rally were not \"patriotic\". \"Multicultural Australia and modern Australia are the same thing... They hate modern Australia,\" he said. Mr Gruter was detained in the early hours of Tuesday, and would have \"very limited\" options to appeal the decision as it was made at a ministerial level, Burke added. The minister had earlier said that anyone on a visa in Australia should consider themselves a guest of the country. \"Like with any household, if a guest turns up to show hatred and wreck the household, they can be told it's time to go home.\" Mr Gruter moved to Australia with his wife and works as a civil engineer, according to ABC News. The National Socialist Network, which organised the rally on 8 November, is a well-known neo-Nazi group in Australia. Demonstrators repeatedly chanted \"blood and honour\", a slogan associated with the Hitler Youth, according to ABC News. New South Wales Premier Chris Minns described the rally, which lasted about 20 minutes, as a \"shocking display of hatred and racism and antisemitism\". Sarah Schwartz, executive officer of the Jewish Council of Australia, told ABC News that neo-Nazi groups were a threat to multiculturalism in the country and there needed to be a distinction between peaceful protests and \"hateful stunts\". \"They're acts of hate speech, and they should be considered as such,\" she said.

Mr Winn said it felt great to give neurodiverse children the chance to shine on stage and behind the scenes. Mr Winn based his panto on the popular Nativity! film story, but added his own twist on the characters and themes. \"The story is all about being understood and to make sure people are not left out,\" he said. \"So there is a very strong message\".

Mark Wood has been passed fit and seems set to play against Australia in Perth on Friday, with the final decision probably between off-spinner Bashir and seamer Brydon Carse. If England opt for an all-pace attack - four specialists plus all-rounder Ben Stokes - it would arguably be the fastest group of bowlers they have fielded in an Ashes Test in this country. On Wednesday Western Australia pitch curator Isaac McDonald said to expect \"pace and bounce\" from the surface at Perth Stadium, and it seems likely England will stick to a long-standing plan of an exclusively pace attack. But the tourists have also noted a dryness to the pitch, bringing Bashir into contention. In the short history of this venue - five previous Tests have been staged here - Australia off-spinner Nathan Lyon is the leading wicket-taker with 29. England have backed Bashir, 22, as their first-choice spinner for more than a year and in May he became the youngest England bowler to reach 50 wickets in Tests. But he has not played a competitive game since taking the final wicket in a dramatic victory over India in the third Test at Lord's in July. Bashir has been out with a broken finger and struggled in England's only warm-up match against England Lions, returning combined figures of 2-151 from 24 overs. It also raises the prospect of Bashir playing in an Ashes Test without being attached to a county. His contract at Somerset expired at the end of the home summer. However, an England team containing Wood, Jofra Archer, Gus Atkinson, captain Stokes and Carse - all of whom are capable of reaching 90mph - remains the most likely outcome.

It’s been a dream to play in an Ashes series Meet Australia's deadly-accurate 'hired assassin' Blood and tears - what can England expect in Perth this time? Although a number of England Ashes triumphs at home and abroad have been built on pace, they have never fielded as many express pace bowlers in the same team. The side that won at home in the famous series of 2005 included Steve Harmison, Simon Jones and Andrew Flintoff. Raymond Illingworth's triumphant visitors to Australia in 1970-71 had Bob Willis, Peter Lever and John Snow, and the England team that won in 1954-55 included Brian Statham and Frank 'Typhoon' Tyson. Perhaps England's most famous Australian tour of all, the 1932-33 Bodyline series, caused diplomatic tensions between the two countries for a short-bowling plan designed to unsettle the great Don Bradman. On this occasion - one of the most eagerly anticipated Ashes series in recent memory - England are looking to reverse an awful record - they have not won a Test in Australia since 2011. Only five members of the 16-man squad have played a Test in Australia, but Atkinson says that could work in England's favour. \"It could be an advantage,\" he told BBC Sport. \"There are a lot of players who have said they have had some tough times here in Australia. \"For us, we are a very relaxed, very positive group. No scarring. It's very exciting. We all see it as a huge opportunity to do something special.\" Australia's net session on Wednesday was briefly delayed by the threat of lightning. The home side are expected to give a debut to opener Jack Weatherald, with uncapped pace bowler Brendan Doggett also coming in following injuries to captain Pat Cummins and and fellow seamer Josh Hazlewood.

Earlier this year, the PTPA - co-founded by Novak Djokovic in 2020 with a goal of increasing player power -began legal actionagainst the men's and women's tours citing \"anti-competitive practices and a blatant disregard for player welfare\". In September, the four Grand Slams were added to the lawsuit. A letter filed to the United States Southern District Court in New York says the PTPA and TA - which organises the Australian Open - are engaged in \"substantive and productive bilateral settlement discussions\". It asks Judge Margaret Garnett to stay proceedings against TA while a legal agreement is finalised. But the letter also makes clear the request does not apply to the other defendants -  the ATP Tour and the WTA Tour, as well as the French Tennis Federation, the All England Club and the US Tennis Association, which organise the French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open respectively. The 163-page lawsuit lodged in New York in March seeks to end the \"monopolistic control\" of the two tours. The PTPA believes they act as a \"cartel\" by forming agreements with tournaments that cap prize money and prevent potential competitors entering the market. The case also takes aim at an \"unsustainable\" schedule and the ranking system. Players v tennis tours: why the lawsuit and what next? There is now the genuine possibility of TA and the PTPA reaching a final agreement before the Australian Open gets under way in January. Whether TA will offer firm commitments around prize money or scheduling has not been divulged, but an agreement could strengthen the PTPA's hand with the other Grand Slams. The New York case could ultimately result in a jury trial. Separate complaints have been lodged with the European Commission and the UK's Competition and Markets Authority, but the PTPA has previously admitted an out-of-court settlement is a goal. \"The goal is not to litigate this to the end,\" the PTPA's executive director Ahmad Nassar told BBC Sport in March. \"We are absolutely prepared to do that, but that's not what we actually need or want. \"What we want is to get everybody to the table to reform the sport the way that many of them have already spoken about.\" The New York judge is currently considering a motion filed by the ATP and WTA to dismiss the antitrust lawsuit. The ATP said in March it \"strongly rejects the premise of the PTPA's claims\" and described the case as \"entirely without merit\". The WTA referred to a \"baseless legal case which will divert time, attention and resources from our core mission to the detriment of our players and the sport as a whole\". The International Tennis Federation and the International Tennis Integrity Agency were originally listed as defendants, but were removed from the lawsuit in September.

It also has shown that, despite his best efforts, he may have struggled to move attention away from the Epstein files if he had not backed the vote. \"I think he sees that this is an issue he's underwater in with average Republicans,\" said Martha Zoller, a conservative radio host and Republican strategist in Georgia. \"I think Trump had to do this in this point in time because he wants to be back on the right side,\" she added. A NPR/PBS News/Marist poll taken at the end of September - when Trump was yet to back the release of the files - suggested that 67% of Republican registered voters supported the release of all Epstein files with victims' names redacted. Another 18% supported releasing some of the files with similar redactions. \"Transparency on what happened is extremely important to the voters,\" Chris Ager, the former chair of the New Hampshire Republican Party, told the BBC. He praised Trump's reversal, arguing it was the sign of a healthy party \"that you can have a disagreement on an issue... and come to a conclusion where essentially everyone is agreeing: Let's release the files\". For much of this year, however, there were sharp disagreements on the issue. Trump's reversal came as it looked increasingly likely he could face a revolt in the House. The most notable defector, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, said at a press conference with Epstein survivors on Tuesday that the saga had \"ripped Maga apart\". Due to her vocal opposition, Trump dubbed her a \"traitor\" on Truth Social. Typically, such a public attack from the president would quiet dissent from a Republican, especially one up for re-election. But in a sign of the political potency of the Epstein issue, Greene pushed back. \"He called me a traitor for standing with these women and refusing to take my name off this discharge petition,\" Greene said on Tuesday. The House would advance the legislation, Greene said, \"because the American people who we serve as representatives here in Congress demanded this vote happen\". Greene, who first broke with Trump in the spring, has been the public face of building dissent within Trump's Maga movement - not just on Epstein, but on other issues such as the US bombing of Iranian nuclear sites in June and the president's continuing focus on foreign wars. But on the Epstein issue in particular, Greene and others in the movement have called for greater transparency despite Trump's desire to focus on other issues. And after Tuesday's votes in Congress, they can claim real success. \"The saga reveals how much power the Republican base now wields,\" party strategist Rina Shah told NPR in the summer. \"MAGA voters are furious.\" \"This pressure is forcing even the most loyal Trump allies to break ranks. And it signals a Republican Party that's increasingly populist, where the grassroots can push leaders to act or they have to pay a price.\" The Epstein vote has also overshadowed other White House initiatives. Last week,President Trump announced he would roll back tariffs on grocerieslike coffee, bananas and beef as Americans' cost of living concerns increased. \"I think he'd rather people talk about those things than Epstein,\" Zoller, the Republican strategist in Georgia, said. One senior Trump administration official told Axiosthat the president decided to drop his opposition to the legislation because the noise around the Epstein issue was proving to be a \"major distraction\". Greene herself has said the White House was going down the wrong track by resisting the release of more Epstein files, instead of focusing on other issues. \"It's insanely the wrong direction to go,\" Greenetold POLITICO. \"The five-alarm fire is healthcare and affordability for Americans. And that's where the focus should be.\" The White House, meanwhile, said in a statement to the BBC that \"by releasing thousands of pages of documents, co-operating with the House Oversight Committee's subpoena request, and President Trump recently calling for further investigations into Epstein's Democrat friends, the Trump Administration has done more for the victims than Democrats ever have.\" Even beyond Epstein, Trump's influence on the party has been tested - and even rebuffed this week. And there are signs of potential rifts, too. His public efforts to encourage Indiana's leaders to redraw their congressional maps to favour Republicans before the 2026 midterm elections hit a potentially critical roadblock on the same day as the Epstein vote. The Republican-controlled Indiana Senate voted on Tuesday to adjourn until January, signalling it would not take up the issue of redistricting. That is despite major pressure from the president as well as the state's Republican governor who has asked lawmakers to work on redrawing maps. Trump has even threatened to back primary challenges to senators who oppose redistricting. But as with the Epstein issue, there has been defiance within the party. \"I've been a legislator 42 years. I'm not going to change my vote,\" Republican Senator Vaneta Becker told CNN. Referring to the nickname for people from Indiana, she said: \"Hoosiers are not used to being sort of in a blackmail position. It does not bode well.\" But as those close to Trump have noted, he has navigated fallouts and internal opposition in the past. Despite this defiance on several fronts, the president remains the most powerful figure in the party. \"I think the president is going to be praised for the fact that the information gets released and is out. At the end of the day, it's results, not the sausage making that got us there,\" said Mr Ager, referring to the Epstein files. Trump said as much himself in a Truth Social posted Tuesday night, remarking that he did not care when Senate Republicans passed the bill. “I just don't want Republicans to take their eyes off all of the Victories that we've had.\""}

John Healey told reporters the \"deeply dangerous\" move from the Yantar was being taken \"extremely seriously\" by the government. He added that the vessel was north of Scotland and had entered UK waters for the second time this year during the last few weeks. The UK would continue monitoring the ship and had \"military options ready should the Yantar change course,\" he added. \"My message to Russia and to Putin is this: we see you. We know what you're doing. And if the Yantar travels south this week, we are ready,\" he added. Healey said the laser incident took place whilst the Yantar was being followed by a Royal Navy frigate and RAF Poseidon P-8 planes deployed to \"track the vessel's every move\". It is understood the episode occurred within the last two weeks. Speaking at a news conference in Downing Street, the defence secretary added he had changed the Royal Navy's rules of engagement so that it could follow the Yantar more closely \"when it is in our wider waters\". Healey said the vessel, which entered service in 2015, was part of Russia's Main Directorate for Deep Sea Research (GUGI), which was designed to \"undertake surveillance in peacetime and sabotage in conflict\". \"We have military options ready should the Yantar change course. I am not going to reveal those because that only makes President Putin wiser,\" he said. Asked about the risks posed by lasers, Healey replied: \"Anything that impedes, disrupts or puts at risk pilots in charge of British military planes is deeply dangerous.\" The Russian Embassy released a statement, saying it was \"not interested in British underwater communications\". \"The actions of our country do not touch interests of the UK and they are not aimed at undermining its security,\" the statement said. It added: \"However, London, with its Russophobic path and increasing militaristic hysteria leads to further degradation European security, providing the premise for new dangerous situations. \"We call on the British side to hold off taking any destructive steps which might aggravate the crisis situation on the European continent.\" Labour MP Matt Western, who chairs the Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy, said: \"Today's news demonstrates once again that Russia presents a genuine and immediate threat to the UK's security.\" He added: \"I welcome the seriousness with which the defence secretary is treating this issue, but there is more we can do. More assertive retaliation may be required.\" The defence secretary previouslyissued a warningabout the Yantar after it was spotted in UK waters in January, calling it \"another example of growing Russian aggression\". According to the ship tracking website Marine Traffic, the ship has not broadcast its location since 2 November, and was last tracked in the Baltic Sea north of the Latvian Coast. On 6 November, the Dutch Navy said two of its vessels escorted the Yantar out of the North Sea, where it was operating near Dutch territorial waters. While the Yantar's current position is not clear, flight tracking website FlightRadar24 shows an RAF Poseidon P-8 surveillance plane circling off the Scottish coast, although it is not certain that this is tracking the Yantar. Russia describes Yantar, which is operated by the country's Ministry of Defence, as an oceanic research vessel. Western nations have often tracked it in European waters and they suspect part of its mission has been to map undersea cables. Elisabeth Braw, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, an American security think tank, said the Yantar's use of lasers was \"an escalation for sure\". \"Essentially, you do it to impede the pilots from doing their work,\" she told BBC Radio 4's World At One. \"We don't know exactly how strong the lasers were, but even if they didn't blind the pilots, it was provocative,\" she added. The UK and its Nato allies areconcerned about the risk Russia posesto offshore cables, pipelines and other infrastructure critical to internet connectivity. In his speech, the defence secretary warned about Russian incursions into Nato airspace, as well as the threats posed by China and armed conflicts around the world, adding: \"Our world is changing. It is less predictable. It is more dangerous.\" Meanwhile, the Ministry of Defence has come undercriticism from a committee of MPsfor being over-reliant on US defence resources and not being prepared to defend the UK and its overseas territories from military attack. The committee said the UK and its European allies should be building up their capabilities to prepare for potential US withdrawal. Healey said the UK government \"takes a different view\" to the committee about America's commitment to Nato. But he said the committee was \"right to say\" Britain should \"pick up the pace of our commitment\" and that was something Labour has been doing since it came to power last year. The report comes as British negotiators race to agree a deal with the EU to enable British defence companies to contribute to projects funded by a new €150bn (£130bn) EU defence loan schemeset to launch next year. The Labour government wants to conclude a deal in the coming weeks to allow British companies to take part in the first round of bids from EU countries, with applications due by the end of this month. Healey told reporters the UK wanted to be part of the programme, but not \"at any price\", amid reports the two sides are at odds over the entry fee the UK could pay to enable British firms to take part. It has been reported that the EU is demanding an entry fee running to billions of euros before the UK can take part. He added that any financial contribution to take part would have to be \"good value for money for our taxpayers and our industry\"."}

But the rules weren't always so strict. In 2016, Jeff Stein, a veteran journalist covering the US intelligence community, got a tip-off: a small insurance company that specialised in selling liability insurance to FBI and CIA agents had been sold to a Chinese entity. \"Someone with direct knowledge called me up and said, 'Do you know that the insurance company that insures intelligence personnel is owned by the Chinese?'\" he remembers. \"I was astonished!\" In 2015, the insurer, Wright USA, had been quietly purchased by Fosun Group, a private company believed to have very close connections with China's leadership. US concerns became immediately clear: Wright USA was privy to the personal details of many of America's top secret service agents and intelligence officials. No one in the US knew who might have access to that information now the insurer and its parent, Ironshore, were Chinese-owned. Wright USA wasn't an isolated case. The BBC has exclusive early access to new data that shows how Chinese state money has been flowing into wealthy countries, buying up assets in the US, Europe, the Middle East and Australia. In the past couple of decades China has become the world's biggest overseas investor, giving it the potential to dominate sensitive industries, secrets and key technologies. Beijing considers the details of its foreign spending overseas – how much money it's spending and where - to be a state secret. But on the terms of the Wright USA sale, Stein says: \"There was nothing illegal about it; it was in the open, so to speak. But because everything's intertwined so closely in Beijing, you're essentially giving that [information] up to Chinese intelligence.\" The Chinese government was involved in the deal: fresh data seen by the BBC reveals that four Chinese state banks had provided a $1.2bn (£912m) loan, routed through the Cayman Islands, to allow Fosun to buy Wright USA. Stein's story ran in Newsweek magazine. And there was a swift reaction in Washington: triggering an inquiry by the branch of the US Treasury that screens investments, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). Shortly after, the company was sold again - back to Americans. It's unclear who ordered that sale. Fosun and Starr Wright USA, the company that now owns Wright USA, did not respond to a BBC request for comment. High-level US intelligence sources confirm the Wright USA sale was one of the cases that led the first Trump administration to tighten its investment laws in 2018. Very few could have understood at the time that this Chinese state-backed spending appears to have been part of a much bigger strategy carried out by Beijing to invest and buy assets in every continent. \"For many years, we assumed that virtually all of China's money flows were going to developing countries,\" says Brad Parks, executive director of AidData. \"And so, it came as a great surprise to us when we realised that actually there were hundreds of billions of dollars going into places like the US, the UK and Germany, happening right underneath our noses.\" AidData is a research lab based in Virginia that specialises in tracking how governments spend their money outside their borders.  It's based at William & Mary, one of America's oldest universities and it gets its funding from governments and charitable organisations around the world. For the past 12 years, AidData has had a major focus on China. A four-year effort involving 120 researchers has led to thefirst known effort to tally all of China's state-backed investments around the world. The group's entire dataset is available open source although the BBC was given exclusive advance access. AidData's key discovery: since 2000, Beijing has spent $2.1 trillion outside its borders, with a roughly equal split between developing and wealthy countries. \"China has a kind of financial system that the world has never seen,\" says Victor Shih, director of the 21st Century China Centre at University of California San Diego. China has the largest banking system in the world – larger than the US, Europe and Japan put together, he adds. That size, along with the amount of control Beijing exerts over state banks, gives it unique capabilities. \"The government controls interest rates and directs where the credit goes,\" Mr Shih says. \"This is only possible with very strict capital control, which no other country could have on a sustainable basis.\" Some of the investments in wealthy economies appear to have been made in order to generate a healthy return. Others fall in line with Beijing's strategic objectives, set out a decade ago in a major government initiative called Made in China 2025. In it the Chinese authorities outlined a clear plan to dominate 10 cutting-edge industries, like robotics, electric vehicles and semiconductors by this year. Beijing wanted to fund big investments abroad so key technologies could be brought back to China. Global alarm at the plan led China to drop public mention of it, but Victor Shih says it \"stayed very much alive\" as a guiding strategy. \"There are all kinds of plans still being published,\" he says, \"including an artificial intelligence plan and a smart manufacturing plan. However, the mother of all plans is the 15th five-year plan.\" At a key meeting of the Communist Party last month, China's leaders  set the goal of accelerating \"high-level scientific and technological self-reliance and self-improvement\" until 2030. AidData's new database highlights state-backed spending overseas that matches the 10 sectors targeted in 2015. The BBC's earlier reporting detailed howthe Chinese government bankrolled the purchase of a UK semiconductor company. The United States, the UK and many other major economies have tightened their investment screening mechanisms after each country appears to have been caught off-guard by deals like the sale of the insurer, Wright USA. AidData's Brad Parks says wealthy governments didn't realise at first that Chinese investments in each country were part of Beijing's larger strategy. \"At first blush, they thought it was just a lot of individual initiative from Chinese companies,\" he says. \"I think what they've learned over time is that actually Beijing's party state is behind the scenes writing the cheques to make this happen.\" However, it must be underlined that such investments and purchases are legal, even if they are sometimes obscured within shell companies or routed through offshore accounts. \"The Chinese government has always required Chinese enterprises operating overseas to strictly comply with local laws and regulations, and has consistently supported them in conducting international co-operation based on mutual benefit,\" the Chinese embassy in London told the BBC. \"Chinese companies not only provide quality products and services to people around the world, but also contribute actively to local economic growth, social development and job creation.\" China's spending patterns are changing, the AidData database shows, with Beijing's state money flowing to countries that have decided to welcome Chinese investment. In the Netherlands there's been debate around Nexperia, a troubled Chinese-owned semiconductor company. It shows up in the AidData database too – Chinese state banks loaned $800m to help a Chinese consortium acquire Nexperia in 2017. Two years later, the ownership passed to another Chinese company - Wingtech. Nexperia's strategic value was highlighted when the Dutch authorities took control of the company's operations in September -  in part, the Dutch government said, over concerns that Nexperia's technology was at risk of being transferred to other parts of the larger Wingtech company. That bold move had resulted in Nexperia effectively being cut into two – separating Dutch operations from its Chinese manufacturing. Nexperia confirmed to the BBC that its Chinese business had stopped operating within Nexperia's governance framework and was ignoring instructions. The company said it welcomed China's commitment to resuming exports of its critical chips to global markets. Xiaoxue Martin, a research fellow at the Clingendael Institute in The Hague, says many in the Netherlands were surprised at how the government handled the case, since they've always managed their relationship with China carefully in the past. \"We're a country that has always done very well with open trade, free trade. And this is really the merchant side of Dutch policy,\" she says. \"Only recently we found that actually, hold on - geopolitics makes it necessary to have more industrial policy, to have this investment screening, when in the past there wasn't that much attention for this.\" Xiaoxue Martin is clear – it's easy to go too far down the path of fearing what could happen as a result of doing so much business with a superpower like China. \"There's a danger of making it seem as if China is this monolith, that they all want the same thing, and that they're all out to get Europe, and to get the United States, when obviously that's not the case,\" she says. \"Most companies, especially if they're private, they just want to make money. They want to be treated as a normal company. They don't want to have this negative reception that they're getting in Europe.\" If China is so far ahead of its rivals in its plans to buy into sensitive sectors, does that mean the race to dominate these arenas is already over? \"No! There's gonna be multiple laps,\" maintains Brad Parks. \"There are many Chinese companies that are still trying to make these types of acquisitions. The difference is, now they're facing higher levels of scrutiny to vet these inbound sources of foreign capital. \"So China makes its move. China is not the follower any more, it is the leader. It is the pace setter. But what I'm anticipating is that many G7 countries are going to move from the back foot to the front foot. \"They're going to move from defence to offence.\""}

Students at National Star College in Gloucestershire met executives from a global tech company to talk about how AAC (Augmentative and Alternative Communication) devices can improve. Aid Holmes told the delegates from Smartbox that he used to hate his AAC as a child, but it has since become an essential part of his life. \"Now I take my AAC everywhere I go because I feel naked without it. It would be like someone ripping your voice box out of your body. This is my voice.\" Mr Holmes said a simple solution that would make a big difference would be an AAC device which lasts for 24 hours, \"so I can talk all day without charging\". AACs are varied but many work by people programming phrases using a screen. It can then create phrases using an artificial voice, operate computers and apps or control devices where they live. Hannah Hadley has cerebral palsy and controls her device using what is known as Eye Gaze - which tracks her eye movements to navigate the screen. She told the panel that she would like an app to run her a bath for a sense of independence, and to use her device to pursue her dream of designing adapted fairground rides for disabled people. Emily Harris, speech and language therapist at National Star College, says despite their transformative life changing potential, the speed of using the equipment is restrictive. \"They're very difficult to use,\" she said. \"They're often slow, and so trying to bridge that gap between a typical conversation - in terms of speed and content - and the equipment that the AAC users have available to them is the next big challenge that would make a huge difference.\" As technology develops, experts say the ability of working faster, having increased autonomy and independence will be helped by artificial intelligence (AI). Dougal Hawes, the CEO of SmartBox, said: \"AI is often seen or viewed with fear but in our world AI is a real force for good. \"We were talking to students about tools that will really speed up their rate of communication so you help them with correcting their typing, help them use acronyms to say things quicker. \"We also use an AI technology for voice cloning so people can get a personalised voice that sounds like them and where they're from in the country, their age and it really reflects them and their personality so that is now a feature of our products.\" Andy Perrygrove uses technology that tracks a dot on his glasses to play the guitar and he regularly joins in at open mic nights in Gloucester. His key worker, Dave Stokes, says it can go further. \"Andy's always been a fan of music so to be able to engage in music, something that he's not really been able to do because of his disabilities, has opened up so much for him,\" he said. \"He's using it to sing as well - it can translate what he's doing using AI to actually create a voice and singing lyrics as well, which is phenomenal.\" Chief operating officer of Talk To Me Technologies in the US, Kate Dunning, said what they heard means that they have to keep challenging themselves and making technology even more personalised. \"Never automating for automations sake,\" she said. \"Always thinking about that end user and using the idea of 'what do they have to say' and 'how will they best to say it'.\" Follow BBC Gloucestershire onFacebook,XandInstagram.

Nick Glynne, the boss of Buy It Direct which owns Appliances Direct, told BBC 5 Live's Wake Up To Money that future prospects for hiring people in the UK was \"very bleak\" for his business. The company employs more than 800 staff and more than 500 jobs were estimated to go. This was not a \"fixed plan\", though the process was being sped up by extra costs placed on the firm by the government, Mr Glynne said. HM Treasury said higher taxes on employers had allowed it to \"deliver on the priorities of the British people\". Buy It Direct, which is based in Huddersfield, operates a number of online retail brands including Furniture 123. It is a global company, employing another 150 staff overseas, with a customer service operation in the Philippines. Mr Glynne said increases in the national living wage and national insurance contributions, which came into effect in April, were among the government's \"tax decisions [which] have accelerated the direction of travel\". \"So much so that our forecast is to have two-thirds less people, with the same revenue, same activity; two-thirds less people in an office environment within three years, and two-thirds less in our warehouse environment through investment in automation. \"A mixture of AI on the office side, and technology involving robots and automation and mechanisation in the warehouse, means that the future for employing UK people is very bleak for someone like us.\" A HM Treasury spokesperson defended the government as \"pro-business\". It pointed to a corporation tax capped at 25%, and said the government was reforming business rates and had secured trade deals with the US, EU and India. \"The tax decisions we took at the Budget last year mean that we have been able to deliver on the priorities of the British people, from investing in the NHS to cutting waiting lists and putting more money in their pockets with a wage boost for millions,\" the spokesperson said. The retail chief executive's comments come at a time of increasing concern about jobs - especially entry level positions - being lost to AI. Graduatesin graphics designandcomputer scienceare among those who have said they find themselves competing against technology for roles. At the end of last month, Amazonannounced it was axing 14,000 jobs, saying it needed to be \"organised more leanly\" to seize the opportunity provided by AI. Mr Glynne said higher taxes on the business also meant the company had changed how it outsourced roles, recruiting more senior positions outside of the UK. \"It was an experiment which we wouldn't otherwise have done, and mostly it's been successful,\" he said. \"So we've now got accountants, managers, traders, buyers, senior IT managers all working abroad. \"You look at many of the roles overseas, just as qualified, more motivated in some ways than UK workers because there's less protection for people often in those countries [from] where we buy in cheaper labour.\""}

Some have managed: the UK got in first, with a sweet deal of just 10%, the European Union crept in behind with 15%. Still more than they were subject to before Mr Trump's \"liberation day\", but less than they had feared. Spare a thought then for Switzerland, which has been hit with punitive tariffs of 39%, and has so far been unable to persuade the US president to relent. Switzerland is not in the EU, so it can't benefit from the deal struck by Brussels. But Switzerland is regularly ranked as the world's most competitive and innovative economy. It is also one of the biggest investors in the US, creating, Swiss business leaders say, 400,000 jobs. That's why they find the US strategy not only outrageous, but inexplicable. \"Thirty nine percent tariffs: I was just shocked,\" says Jan Atteslander, director of international relations for the Swiss business federation Economiesuisse. \"This is unjustified, you can't explain why they are so high.\" Since the tariffs (the highest in Europe and the fourth-highest worldwide) were announced on 1 August, the Swiss government has been desperately trying to renegotiate with Washington, to no avail. The US president, it seems, has moved on to other matters. Around 17% of all Swiss exports go to the US, a market Switzerland cannot afford to lose overnight. Now that the tariffs have come into effect, the once muscular Swiss economy is suffering. Economic growth is shrinking, and job losses in key industries appear inevitable. Switzerland's most lucrative exports to the US are pharmaceuticals. Ironically, they are not affected by the 39% tariffs, but might be subject to the 100% tariff on imported medicines that Trump recently threatened. That would be another huge blow. Another big Swiss exporter to the US is Switzerland's world-leading medical technology industry. \"It's precision mechanics, it has its roots in the watchmaking industry,\" explains Adrian Hunn, who is managing director of Swiss Medtech, the trade body representing the industry. The town of Biel, the historic home of Swiss watchmaking, and now the site of medical technology companies, demonstrates why there may be no winners, but only losers, from Washington's tariff policy. The company MPS (short for micro precision systems), produces medical instruments from aortic valve replacements to the tiniest of surgical drills, used in hip or knee replacements. Just the kind of things a wealthy country with an ageing, and increasingly overweight population – like the US – needs. So precise is the production process, that even the machines used to produce the devices are made and specially calibrated locally. \"It's a very integrated way of working,\" explains MPS's CEO Gilles Robert. \"Measuring equipment, milling tools, cutting liquids. That's why we call it an ecosystem that we have here in Switzerland.\" Mr Robert's proudest product is the engine for the world's only medically-registered artificial heart. Just 120 of them have been transplanted worldwide. \"It's a pump that will pulse in both sides, to create beating in both chambers, and allow people currently waiting for a transplant, people with terminal heart deficiencies, to keep on living.\" Technology like this is very different from the car industry, where, often, the brakes are made in one country, the windscreen wipers or door handles in another, and everything is assembled in a third. That's why Mr Robert is not convinced that Trump's stated strategy of moving production to the US could work. \"It would be extremely challenging if not impossible to separate the components from the actual product assembly,\" he says. \"And I think those types of skills would be extremely hard to find in the US.\" Trump has said the countries hit with tariffs will \"eat them\". So can MPS absorb the 39%? \"They had the best price before the new tariffs came into effect,\" says Mr Robert. \"We don't have the leeway to give a discount to our customers, because the margins are already as low as they can be.\" Instead, says Adrian Hunn of SwissMedTech, \"Medical devices will get more expensive for US patients.\" And he adds, probably for US taxpayers as well. \"Costs for hospitals and healthcare systems in the US in many cases are funded by public reimbursement programmes, and this means taxpayers bear the burden.\" Perhaps even more worrying for patients, since some high precision medical devices are made only in Switzerland, is the possibility that Swiss companies will stop exporting to the US altogether. \"These are companies that have very good products,\" says Jan Atteslander of Economiesuisse. \"And they have told us, we just stopped delivering, sorry guys.\" Mr Atteslander and Mr Hunn agree with the Swiss government's strategy of not retaliating to the US tariffs. Switzerland's David, the thinking goes, cannot realistically take on America's Goliath. But the Swiss are actively chasing other markets. A trade deal with India –  \"the fastest growing economy on the planet, 1.4 billion potential consumers,\" Mr Atteslander points out – came into force on 1 October. An agreement with South American trade block Mercosur has also just been concluded, Switzerland's longstanding trade deal with China is being upgraded, and free trade with the EU, the market for 50% of all Swiss export, remains intact. So although the US tariffs are already damaging the Swiss economy, and some still cling to hope that Trump may change his mind, there is also a quiet confidence that Switzerland will, if it has to, weather this storm. \"To be a successful export nation, you have to have resilience in your DNA,\" says Mr Atteslander. The more long-term damage may be to the traditionally good business relations between the two countries. In Switzerland, there is a real feeling of hurt. The US wasn't just an important market: the Swiss loved doing business there. Many thought they had found entrepreneurial soulmates, more oriented to the free market than their more regulated partners in the EU. Now, both Adrian Hunn of SwissMedTech and Gilles Robert of MPS have abandoned that notion – for now at least. \"I lived six years in the US, so I was very close,\" says Mr Hunn. \"I have a lot of friends there. So, this, it didn't change my view of America, but it did change my view, you know, of how the current administration in the US is acting globally, and treating allies.\" \"I studied a year in the US,\" says Mr Robert. \"It had an impact on me, on my way of looking at the world. How you can take risks, be an entrepreneur, and be positive about the future.\" But, he adds hopefully: \"Even though I'm sad about this situation, we will overcome, we'll find solutions, and I'm sure in the end reason will prevail.\""}

And that was even before his teamlost 4-1at home to Norway on Sunday, confirming they will now enter the lottery of play-offs to secure a place at the 2026 World Cup. You can understand why Gattuso would be concerned, given Italy missed the World Cup in 2018 and 2022 after being beaten by Sweden and North Macedonia respectively in the play-offs. For the first time, the 2026 tournament - which will be staged in Canada, Mexico and the United States next June and July - will feature 48 nations. By finishing second in their group, Italy have to face two single-leg play-offs to secure their place at the World Cup, which they won in 1934, 1938, 1982 and 2006. Gattuso bemoaned that having a good qualifying record - Italy won six of their eight games - isn't enough because they finished as runners-up, and highlighted South America's six direct qualification slots and Africa's nine. Was Gattuso making a fair point? Or was it just sour grapes? Italy fighting to avoid another 'apocalyptic' World Cup failure How Haaland fired Norway to the World Cup The Italy coach was speaking on Friday, when goal difference meant their fate was effectively sealed before they played Norway. \"In my day, the best [group] runners-up went straight to the World Cup, now the rules have changed,\" Gattuso said. \"Italy's record of six wins? You'd have to ask the people who make the groups and the rules. \"In 1990 and 1994, there were two African teams, now there are nine. It's not a controversy, but there are difficulties, and we know it well. \"If we look at South America, where six out of 10 teams go directly to the World Cup and the seventh heads into a play-off with a team from Oceania, that does give you regrets and a certain sadness. That is the disappointment. The system needs to change in Europe.\" There are some factual inaccuracies in what Gattuso said. Firstly, three African nations took part in the 1994 World Cup. And Bolivia - who finished seventh in South America - are not certain to play a team from Oceania, which would be New Caledonia. Even if they did that would be in a semi-final with another game against one of the two highest-ranked nations to win one of the last places at the World Cup. Also, in 1990 not all runners-up automatically qualified automatically, with Denmark missing out. How will World Cup play-offs be determined? From Spurs fringes to Dutch delight - Parrott's rise to Irish hero Italy are in danger of missing out on the World Cup for a third successive time Firstly, we need to consider why European World Cup qualifying works as it does. There used to be far fewer countries playing international football than there are today. In 1990, 32 Uefa nations took part in qualifying and in 1994 there were 39. Today, there are 54 Uefa nations competing to be one of 16 European teams that will make it to next summer's World Cup finals. More teams means more games, especially if you try to keep a system of group winners and runners-up qualifying. Technically, you could do this by having eight groups of six or seven countries. However, a seven-team group would need 12 matchdays, and the international match calendar only has 10 slots each year. You would have to increase the footprint of World Cup qualifying and scrap the Uefa Nations League. Uefa decided to go with smaller groups of four and five nations partly to limit the intensity of qualifying - the opposite of what Gattuso suggests. Italy were the top seeds in their group and were perhaps unfortunate to be placed with Norway, one of the fastest-improving teams. But they lost both games convincingly, by an aggregate score of 7-1. Brazil qualified for the World Cup despite losing six games, but would anyone question their participation? Only 10 countries in South America take part in World Cup qualifying, with six automatic slots. That is 60%, compared to 29.62% of Uefa. But we need to consider the relative strengths of the confederations. The lowest ranked country in South America are Bolivia in 76th, while eight of the 10 sit inside the top 50. That's by far the highest proportion of top-level countries. Uefa has 26 teams inside the top 50 - just under 50% - and 20 countries ranked lower than Bolivia. Of the 20, only Kosovo still have a chance of qualifying. Granted, Bolivia's 10 defeats while still having a route to the World Cup sticks out, but they did have eight matches against teams in the world's top 20. Italy had it much easier, with Norway ranked 43rd at the start of European qualifying (they're now 29th). Then there's the travel, with the best players having to fly from Europe to South America for 18 qualifiers across nine separate two-game international breaks over two years. They usually play one game at home and one away, and that means more travel. It's a more gruelling process, while Italy played eight matches this year with minimal relative travel. With the exception of Cape Verde, who are making their debut next year, Africa's qualifiers are all established on the world stage: Algeria, Egypt, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Morocco, Senegal, South Africa and Tunisia. Six are in the world's top 50 with Ghana, in 73rd, the lowest-ranked of the nine. It would be a stretch to suggest any of these countries don't deserve to be there over a European nation. But what do the numbers tell us? Let's use relative strength again by looking at the top 50 and weighting it to the confederation. Uefa has seen its share of the World Cup places fall, from 54% in the 1990s, to 33.33% today - yet nearly half of its teams (46.30%) are inside the top 50. So, is it fair that Europe was only given three more slots when Fifa added another 16 places for the 2026 event? Africa now gets nine places with 53 participants, 21.43% of the automatic slots but only seven (14%) are inside the world's top 50. That suggests they might be over-represented by a small amount, but not too much. Concacaf is about on point with relative strength. It now gets six nations at the World Cup (14.29%), with five of its 32 teams (15.63%) in the top 50. The real outlier is Asia, which has only four of its 46 participating nations (8.70%) in the top 50, yet it gets eight automatic places (19.05%). So perhaps Gattuso did have a point in there somewhere, but he's unlikely to get any sympathy.

Mohammad Akhlaq, then 50, was beaten to death after rumours spread that he had stored and consumed beef, a claim his family continues to deny. Slaughter of cows is a sensitive issue in India as the animal is considered sacred by Hindus, who comprise 80% of the country's 1.2 billion people. Uttar Pradesh is among the 20 states with strict laws banning cow slaughter and the sale and consumption of beef. The attack, which took place in Dadri - 49km (31 miles) from the capital Delhi - was the first major and widely reported case of cow-related violence in India and sparked widespread protests. Akhlaq's family's lawyer told BBC Hindi that 18 people were charged for various offences, including murder and rioting. All of them are out on bail. Now the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led state government of Uttar Pradesh has asked a local court to drop the charges against the men. In an application filed last month, the public prosecutor argued there were \"inconsistencies\" in the witness testimonies in identifying the accused and asked the court to close the case. The court is expected to decide on whether it would accept the application on 12 December. The news has shocked Akhlaq's family, who say they are prepared to challenge the government's plea. \"We never thought that our fight of 10 years would be attempted to be closed off like this,\" his younger brother Jaan Mohammad told BBC Hindi. The family left the village shortly after the killing and has not returned. \"Now, we are scared for our safety even more,\" Mr Mohammad said. \"Will this [move to withdraw the case] not embolden the criminals?\" Mr Mohammad says he will never forget the night his brother was murdered. Akhlaq had been sleeping with his 22-year-old son Danish on 28 September 2015, when a mob wielding sticks, swords and cheap pistols barged into their home, accusing the family of having slaughtered a cow and eating it. The family said it later found out that the mob attacked him after an announcement was made from a Hindu temple that someone had slaughtered and eaten a cow. The accused men found some meat in the fridge that the family insists was mutton, and held it as proof. While Akhlaq died on the spot, his son was seriously injured in the attack. The case sparked widespread outrage. Although initial arrests came within a week, the chargesheet took three months to file. Many also criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for speaking about the incident days after Akhlaq's death, while some BJP members, then in power at the federal level, were accused of defending the attackers. One party leader had described thelynching as an \"accident\", while another said consuming beef was unacceptable. The police, in its first chargesheet, named 15 main accused, including a juvenile and a local BJP leader's son, along with 25 witnesses. Four more accused were later added, bringing the total to 19; one died in 2016. Last month, the Uttar Pradesh government argued that witnesses, including Akhlaq's family, had given conflicting statements during the investigation. It noted that Akhlaq's wife initially named 10 people in her complaint, while his daughter Shaista cited 16, and his son Danish 19. \"Despite both the parties living in the same village, the witnesses have changed the number of accused,\" the application says. Mohammad Yusuf Saifi, Akhlaq's family lawyer, said the \"chaos and confusion\" at the time of the incident made it understandable that not every witness saw all involved. \"The only thing to see is whether there is any evidence against the people who have been named,\" he said. The application also noted that police seized five sticks, iron rods and bricks from the accused, but found no firearms or swords, contrary to what Akhlaq's wife had stated in her complaint. It further stated that officials had recovered beef from the scene. In 2016, a  case was filed against Akhlaq's family under the cow slaughter law - and is still pending before a court in Uttar Pradesh. The family has however has repeatedly denied the allegation. Mr Saifi, alleged the case was meant to \"pressurise\" the family, noting that a local veterinary report identified the meat as goat, not cow. As the family anxiously waits for the court's verdict, they are holding out hope. \"I still have faith in the court,\" Akhlaq's brother, Mr Mohammad, said. \"I believe justice would be done one day.\" Follow BBC News India onInstagram,YouTube,XandFacebook."}

Benfica winger Schjelderup, 21, told the court he received a 27-second video on Snapchat and forwarded it to a group chat of four friends before deleting it once he realised its content. Schjelderup, who was 19 and playing for Danish Superliga side Nordsjaelland at the time of the incident, pleaded guilty after co-operating with a police investigation. Schjelderup will only have to serve time in jail if found guilty of another crime during the next 12 months. The prosecution had asked the court to sentence Schjelderup to at least 20 days in prison. His lawyer Anders Nemeth told the court that the defence would take time to deliberate before deciding whether to appeal. Rui Costa, president of Portuguese side Benfica, has previously been reported as saying the club will support Schjelderup. In a statement posted on Instagram on 8 November,Schjelderup apologisedand said he wanted to \"be open to all of you about a stupid mistake I did\". He said he was \"ready to face the consequences\" and urged people not to \"watch or spread videos with harmful or offensive content\". \"The offence I will be convicted for does not reflect on who I am as a person and what I stand for,\" he added. Schjelderup, who has eight caps for Norway, was an unused substitute on Sunday as they beat Italy 4-1 in Milan to qualify for the 2026 Fifa World Cup.

The 30-something Mr Ing'ati had disappeared with no explanation - for years his family desperately tried to track him down, following lead after lead that would eventually dry up. As decades passed, memories of Mr Ing'ati faded. He had no children and many of those close to him passed away. But then, roughly eight decades later, his name re-emerged in British military records. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC), which works to commemorate those who died in the two world wars, contacted Mr Ing'ati's nephew, Benjamin Mutuku, after mining old documents. He learnt that on the day his uncle left his village, Syamatani, he travelled roughly 180km (110 miles) westwards to Nairobi - the seat of the British colonial government then in control of the country. There, he signed up as a private with the East African Scouts, a regiment in the British army that fought in World War Two. The UK recruited millions of men from its empire to fight in both of the 20th Century's global conflicts in theatres across the world. Mr Ing'ati responded to the call for recruits - when exactly is not clear - and then on 13 June 1943, he was killed in action, according to the records unearthed by CWGC. Where and how he died is not known. Like thousands of Kenyans who fought in the British army, he died without his family being notified and was buried in a location unknown to this day. Decades on, as the UK marks Remembrance Sunday to honour those who contributed to the war effort, the sacrifices of many Kenyan soldiers, like Mr Ing'ati, remain unrecognised. The world knows little of their service and they were not formally commemorated in the way their white counterparts were. After all these years, Mr Mutuku was pleased to learn where his uncle had disappeared to and when he died. Despite being born after Mr Ing'ati left the village, Mr Mutuku feels a strong connection to his uncle, from whom he got his name. \"I used to ask my father, where is the person I was named after?\" Mr Mutuku, now 67, tells the BBC. Although he welcomes the fresh information, Mr Mutuku feels angry that his uncle's body is somewhere out in the world, and not buried in Syamatani. His family are from the Akamba ethnic group, who believe being laid to rest near the family home is very important. \"I never got a chance to see a tomb where my uncle got buried,\" Mr Mutuku says. \"I would have liked so much to see that.\" The CWGC is trying to find out where Mr Ing'ati died and where his body is, along with the details of other forgotten Kenyan soldiers. A search is also on for details about East Africans who fought and died during World War One. With help from the Kenyan Defence Forces, the CWGC recently unearthed a treasure trove of rare colonial military records in Kenya dating from that conflict. As a result researchers have been able to recover the names and stories of more than 3,000 soldiers who served at that time. The records, thought to have been destroyed decades ago, concern the King's African Rifles.Comprised of East African soldiers, the regiment fought against  German troops in the region, in what is now Tanzania in World War One, and Japanese troops in what is now Myanmar in World War Two. \"These are not just dusty files - they are personal stories. For many African families, this may be the first time they learn about a relative's wartime service,\" George Hay, a historian at the CWGC, tells the BBC. For example, there is George Williams, a decorated sergeant major with the Kings African Rifles. Described as 5ft 8in (170cm) with a scar on the right side of his chin, Mr Williams received several medals for gallantry and was recognised as a first-class shot. He died, aged 44, in Mozambiquejust four months before the war ended. There are also records for Abdulla Fadlumulla, a Ugandan soldier who enlisted with the King's African Rifles in 1913, aged only 16. He was killed just 13 months later, while assaulting an enemy position in Tanzania. The records demonstrate how the wars \"touched every fabric in Kenya\", Patrick Abungu, a historian at CWGC's Kenya office, says. \"Because the narrative is, they went and never came back. And now we are answering those questions: where they went and where [their bodies] could be,\" he adds. The historian wants to answer these questions for thousands of families across Kenya - his own included. Hisgreat uncle, Ogoyi Ogunde, was conscripted into the British army during World War One and never returned home. \"It's very traumatic to lose a loved one and not know where they are,\" he tells the BBC. \"It does not matter how many years go by, people will always look at the gate and hope that he will walk in one day.\" Mr Abungu and the CWGC hope to build memorials to finally commemorate the thousands of soldiers identified from the newly discovered documents. The organisation also wants the records to help inform Kenya's school curriculum, so that new generations come to understand the outsized, yet overlooked role Africans played in the world wars. \"The only way any of this matters is that it isn't coming from people like me saying, 'This is your history',\" CWGC's Mr Hay says. \"It's about people saying, 'This is our history' - and using the materials that we're working with.\" The CWGC will continue recovering the details of Kenyan individuals who served in the British forces until every fallen soldier is commemorated. \"There is no end date... I mean this could go on for 1,000 years,\" Mr Abungu says. \"The process that is taking place is ensuring that those thousands of people who went away and never came back... we keep their memories going so that we don't forget them.\" Go toBBCAfrica.comfor more news from the African continent.

HP, now known as Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE), bought Mr Lynch's tech firm Autonomy in 2011, but it says Mr Lynch and Autonomy's former chief financial officer, Sushovan Hussain, misrepresented the company's finances. In a 2019 trial, HPE had accused Mr Lynch of inflating Autonomy's revenues which it said forced it to announce an $8.8bn write-down of the company's worth. Mr Justice Hildyard ruled in 2022 that HPE had \"substantially succeeded\" in its claim, but that it was likely to receive \"substantially less\" than the $5bn it sought in damages. Earlier this year, he ruled that HPE suffered losses amounting to around £700m through the purchase of Autonomy. Mr Lynch and his teenage daughter Hannahwere among seven passengers and crew who diedwhen the Bayesian went down off the coast of Sicily last August during a storm which caused the vessel to capsize and sink. A hearing in London, which began on Tuesday, will now decide whether Mr Lynch's estate can appeal against the 2022 and 2025 rulings. In written submissions, Patrick Goodall, the barrister representing HPE, argued that Mr Lynch's estate was liable to pay $1.7bn, which includes around $761m in interest. He said that Mr Lynch had \"not only perpetrated an enormous fraud, but lied about it at every stage\". He said the claimants had spent almost £150m on the legal battle, and were seeking nearly £113m of their costs from Mr Lynch's estate. Mr Goodall also said that Mr Lynch's estate should not be allowed to appeal against either the 2022 or 2025 rulings. In written submissions, Richard Hill, the lawyer representing Mr Lynch's estate, said that the $761m in interest sought by the claimants was an \"excessive sum... based on a flawed analysis\" and that the \"legally and economically rational approach would provide for a materially lower figure\". The claimants' position that \"they were the victors in this litigation\" was \"overly simplistic\", he added. Mr Hill also said that Mr Lynch's estate should be allowed to appeal against the two earlier rulings, claiming that the judge \"erred in law\" and that there was a \"compelling reason for allowing the appeal to be heard\". A spokesperson for the Lynch family said: \"Today's hearing addresses technical matters that change nothing about the underlying substance of the case. \"The core facts remain that HP's claim was fundamentally flawed and a wild overstatement.\" In a separate case, Mr Lynch was extradited to the US in 2023 to face criminal charges, and he was cleared of fraud charges in 2024. He was celebrating being acquitted on his yacht when it sank."}

A new report by the human rights organisation said government agencies also employed surveillance and disinformation to target organisers of the mass protests, which swept Kenya across 2024 and 2025. The demonstrations were driven largely by \"Gen Z\" activists who used social media platforms to mobilise. In response to Amnesty's report, Kenya's interior minister said the government \"does not sanction harassment or violence against any citizen\". But Amnesty said it had uncovered a campaign to \"silence and suppress\" the protesters. Young women and LGBT+ activists were disproportionately targeted, with misogynistic and homophobic comment, as well as AI-generated pornographic images, the report said. The BBC has approached the government for further comment. One activist told Amnesty: \"I had people coming into my inbox and telling me: 'You will die and leave your kids. We will come and attack you'. \"I even had to change my child's school. Someone sent me my child's name, the age... the school bus number plate. They told me: 'If you continue doing what you're doing then we will take care of this child for you'.\" It has long been believed that the government employs a network of individuals, known as \"keyboard warriors\", to push its online messages. The report features a man who said he was part of a team paid between 25,000 and 50,000 Kenyan shillings (about $190-$390; £145-£300) per day to amplify government messaging and drown out trending protest hashtags on social media platform X. As part of its research, Amnesty spoke to 31 young human rights defenders who had participated in the protests. Nine of these activists said they had received violent threats via X, TikTok, Facebook and WhatsApp. As well as digital abuse, the authorities have also been accused of carrying out a brutal crackdown on the protests. More than 100 people died, rights groups say, when police clashed with protesters during two waves of demonstrations - one in 2024 and one in 2025. The authorities were also accused of arbitrary arrests, enforced disappearances and using lethal force against the protesters. The government accepted there had been some case of excessive force by police, butalso defended the security forces in other instances. The demonstrations railed against issues such as proposed tax rises, increasing femicide and corruption. Amnesty chief Agnès Callamard said the organisation's report \"clearly demonstrates widespread and coordinated tactics on digital platforms to silence and suppress protests by young activists\". \"Our research also proves that these campaigns are driven by state-sponsored trolls, individuals and networks paid to promote pro-government messages and dominate Kenya's daily trends on X,\" she added. Kenya's Interior Minister Kipchumba Murkomen said: \"The government of Kenya does not sanction harassment, or violence against any citizen... any officer implicated in unlawful conduct bears individual responsibility and is subject to investigation and sanction.\" Amnesty also raised concerns about unlawful state surveillance, including allegations - denied by Kenya's largest telecom provider, Safaricom - that authorities used mobile data to monitor protest leaders.

There has beenongoing speculationthat Greater Manchester Mayor Burnham wants to take on Sir Keir for the top job, but he would need to be an MP to do so. Lewis told theBBC's Politics Livethat he was willing to step down from his Norwich South seat to allow Burnham to return to the Commons and put \"country before party, party before personal ambition\". Burnham was contacted for comment. Number 10 declined to comment. Lewis, who has been an MP for 10 years, said he had spoken to Burnham, and when asked if he would give up his seat for him, he said it was \"a question I've asked myself\". He added: \"Do you know what? If I'm going to sit here and say country before party, party before personal ambition, then yes, I have to say yes, don't I.\" Last week, he said Sir Keir's position as prime minister was \"untenable\" and told Channel 4 News that Burnham should be given the chance to \"step up\". Later, the Sun's political editor Kate Ferguson said that Lewis had told her he had \"no plans to stand down\". Shereported on Xthat he said: \"A hypothetical question was put to me, and my answer was consistent with what I've been saying, that I am serious about putting country before party.\" Lewis first won his seat in 2015, and last year he increased his majority to more than 13,000. But if he were to step down, any would-be successor would first need to win a selection contest before a by-election was held. Health Secretary Wes Streeting - who last week denied claims he was plotting a leadership bid of his own - told LBC he thought it was a \"peculiar\" move by the Norwich South MP. \"I've got a lot of time for Andy and I think we need our best players on the pitch,\" Streeting said. \"And whether he's doing that as mayor of Greater Manchester or whether he wants to come back into parliament in the next general election, that is an issue for Andy. \"I think it's a bit of a peculiar thing for Clive to have said to his own constituents, 'Oh, well, I'm not interested in being your MP, I'm happy to do a deal with someone'. \"I would just say from personal experience, don't take your voters for granted.\" In September, Burnham said he had\"no intention of abandoning Manchester\"but did not rule out challenging Sir Keir after a series of interviews in which he said colleagues had been urging him to stand. Two Manchester Labour MPs, Andrew Gwynne and Graham Stringer, ruled out standing down for him ahead of the party's conference in September. Sir Keir has, meanwhile, said he willlead Labour into the next general election. It came after a bruising time last week, when anonymous briefings were given to journalists that some cabinet ministers - including Streeting - were plotting to oust him. The ministers concerned have insisted this is not the case - but speculation continues about whether the PM will face a challenge in May, when Labour is expected to do badly in Scottish and Welsh elections, and in English local elections. Anyone mounting a leadership bid would have to secure the backing of 80 Labour MPs. Follow Norfolk news onBBC Sounds,Facebook,InstagramandX."}

Ministers will announce the plan on Wednesday in a bid to tackle touts and resale sites, which often offer music, theatre, comedy and sport tickets at well above face value. Restricting ticket touts was one of theLabour government's election pledges, as fans complained of massively inflated prices for resold tickets. The decision comes a week after dozens of artists including Sam Fender, Dua Lipa and Coldplay urged Sir Keir Starmer to protect fans from exploitation. A consultation on the changes had canvassed viewson capping costs at up to 30% above the face value of a ticket. But the government has decided to set the limit at the original cost, or face value, while also promising to take measures to cap extra fees to prevent the price limit being undermined. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) will announce its intentions to end industrial-scale ticket touting, making resale tickets £37 cheaper on average, saving fans collectively £112m per year. Resale platforms will have a legal duty to monitor and enforce the new regulations. Housing Secretary Steve Reed told BBC Breakfast touts making profits at the expense of fans was \"such an important issue\" as it was \"hugely damaging to individuals having to pay through the nose for tickets\". He stressed the government was \"committed to outlawing it\". The move comes after the open letter by some of the biggest names in music. The music stars urged the prime minister to stop the \"extortionate and pernicious\" websites that exploit fans. Other signatories included consumer watchdog Which?, the Football Supporters' Association, and groups representing the music and theatre industries, venues and ticket retailers. According to analysis by the Competition and Markets Authority, tickets currently sold on the resale market are typically marked up by more than 50%. Investigations by Trading Standards have previously uncovered evidence of tickets being resold for up to six times their original cost. Rocio Concha, director of policy and advocacy at Which?, said the change was \"great news for music and sports fans\", adding that the plan would \"rein in professional touts and put tickets back in the hands of real fans\". She urged the government to \"show that the price cap is a priority by including the necessary legislation in the King's Speech\". Ahead of the announcement, Ticketmaster's parent company Live Nation Entertainment said it already limits resale in the UK to face value prices and described the reported plan as \"another major step forward for fans\". Resale sites like Viagogo and Stubhub have previously claimed that a price cap could push customers towards unregulated sites and social media, putting them at increased risk of fraud. But Tom Kiehl, chief executive of UK Music, said a cap on secondary ticket prices was needed in order to protect both the industry and fans from \"exorbitant\" prices. \"The music industry itself is worth £8bn to the economy, and relies on that strong relationship between music fans and and the artist,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday. \"And what you have at the moment is the resale market, which isn't working.\" Share your ticket resale storieshere"}

This week alone, two people were killed in an attack on a church in Kwara, while a group of 25 girls, who the BBC has been told are Muslim, were abducted from a school. Two of the girls latermanaged to escape from their abductors.A teacher and a security guard - both Muslim - were also killed in the attack on the secondary school in the north-western Kebbi state. Earlier this month, Trump said he would send troops into Nigeria\"guns a-blazing\"if its government \"continues to allow the killing of Christians\". The Nigerian government has pushed back on these claims, describing them as \"a gross misrepresentation of reality\". An official said that \"terrorists attack all who reject their murderous ideology - Muslims, Christians and those of no faith alike\". Organisations monitoring political violence in Nigeria say most victims of the jihadist groups are Muslims. The country's 220 million people are roughly evenly split between followers of the two religions, with Muslims in the majority in the north, where most jihadist attacks take place. For months, right-wing campaigners and politicians in Washington have been alleging that Islamist militants were systematically targeting Christians in Nigeria. But the BBC has found that some of the data being relied on to come to this conclusion is difficult to verify. Deadly disputes are also often over vital resources like land and water or fuelled by inter-ethnic tensions, rather than religion, say analysts. Minaj, whose real name is Onika Tanya Maraj-Petty, told an event organised by the US embassy to the UN in New York that calling for the protection of Christians in Nigeria was \"not about taking sides or dividing people... but about uniting humanity\". \"This is about standing up in the face of injustice. It's about what I've always stood for,\" she added. The 42-year-old Trinidad-born rapper, who grew up in the US, has previously spoken of her Christian faith. She thanked Trump for \"prioritising this issue and for his leadership\". On Wednesday, Nigerian police in the south-western Kwara state confirmed a deadly attack on a church in the town of Eruku, where gunmen opened fire on worshippers the previous day, killing two people and abducting several others. Local media say armed men, identified by residents as bandits, stormed the Christ Apostolic Church during an evening programme on Tuesday evening, shooting the pastor and rounding up the faithful at gunpoint. Images and short video clips - believed to be from the church's CCTV cameras - have circulated widely online, showing terrified people scrambling for safety, including an elderly woman seen desperately trying to escape the gunmen. On Tuesday, President Bola Tinubu confirmed that jihadist forces had killed a senior army officer, after he had been captured in an ambush. The Islamic State West Africa Province (Iswap) said on Monday its fighters had killed Brigadier General Musa Uba in the north-eastern state of Borno. The Nigerian army had earlier denied that the officer had been abducted and killed. The latest attacks have triggered frustration and anger across Nigeria, with many lamenting what they see as an unending wave of insecurity affecting rural communities, churches, schools and major transport routes. In a statement on Wednesday, President Tinubu said he was \"fully apprised of the recent uptick in violent extremism\" across the country, adding that the surge had left him \"depressed\". He directed security agencies to respond with \"urgency, clarity, and decisive action\" to what he described as attacks by the \"heartless terrorists\". He also postponed his trip to the G20 summit in South Africa to deal with the wave of attacks. Minaj described Nigeria as \"a beautiful nation with deep faith traditions\" and even acknowledged the \"beautiful Barbz\" - her fans - in the West African country. The US ambassador to the UN, Mike Waltz,thanked the rapperfor \"leveraging her massive platform to spotlight the atrocities against Christians in Nigeria\". Last year Minaj publicly revealed that despite moving from her native Trinidad to New York at an early age,she still does not have US citizenship. Her appearance at the UN on Tuesday is her highest-profile political intervention to date. She made headlines during the pandemic for sharingdisinformation about side-effects of the Covid vaccine- claiming that when a friend of her cousin had the jab, it caused his testicles to swell up and he became impotent. \"His friend was weeks away from getting married, now the girl called off the wedding,\"Minaj wrote online. Her comments werecriticised by the UK's chief medical officer at the time, and then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson also commented, joking: \"I am not as familiar with the works of Nicki Minaj as I probably should be.\" In recent months, her years-long feud with fellow New York rapper Cardi B escalated to themtrading insults about each others' careers and family members.

She told a conference of police leaders \"the structure of our police forces is, if we are honest, irrational\". Mahmood said \"disparities in performance\" meant that policing in England and Wales was a \"postcode lottery\". Some police chiefs want the number of forces to be reduced. Currently, there are 43  in England and Wales. The government is expected to publish a White Paper on the future of policing next month. The home secretary was talking at a conference of police leaders organised by the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) and the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners (APCC). Last week the Home Office announced thatthe role of Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) would be abolished. Mahmood told delegates on Wednesday the position \"had not worked\". She told the conference \"I was a reformer at the Ministry of Justice. I will be a reformer at the Home Office too.\" Mahmood told the delegates - mostly senior officers and Police and Crime Commissioners: \"The structure of our police forces is, if we are honest, irrational. \"We have loaded critical functions like the national police air service and vetting onto local forces, drawing attention away from neighbourhood policing. \"We have 43 forces tackling criminal gangs who cross borders, and the disparities in performance in forces across the country have grown far too wide, giving truth to the old store that policing in this country is a postcode lottery.\" She said the government's plans would be laid out in a White Paper due in December, saying she wanted to see \"that national policing is world class without distracting local forces from neighbourhood policing\". \"The detail will follow,\" she said. She did not stay behind to answer questions. Some police chiefs favour a reduction in the number of forces. In July, Gavin Stephens, NPCC chair, said: \"A smaller number of police forces, supported by a national policing organisation, would enable us to make decisions far quicker and maximise funding to invest in technology and our workforce.\" But some local PCCs have opposed the idea of force mergers. Last week the Policing Minister Sarah Jones said the role would be abolished. PCCs are elected officials, but elections have often had a limited turnout. The role was created by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government in 2012. The home secretary said in her speech on Wednesday: \"I believe the position of a Police and Crime Commissioner, unfortunately, has not worked. \"Without necessary investment in creating a public profile, too many voters were unaware of the existence of the position, or its occupant.\" Police forces are also waiting for the latest funding settlement which is due in early December. Paul Sanford, Chief Constable of Norfolk Constabulary and Chair of the NPCC Finance Coordination Committee, said: \"Policing is in a state of financial distress. \"We are seeing declining financial resilience across all forces.\""}

In a complaint filed with French prosecutors, a human rights group accused TotalEnergies of complicity in war crimes, including the torture and execution of dozens of civilians held by local security forces in a cluster of shipping containers at its facility. Total has always denied responsibility for the actions of government troops and related security forces who were involved in guarding the Afungi peninsula gas refinery development. It was the biggest foreign investment project in Africa at the time. The complaint was filed by the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR), a human rights group. \"Companies and their executives are not neutral actors when they operate in conflict zones. If they enable or fuel crimes, they might be complicit and should be held accountable,\" said Clara Gonzales, the ECCHR's co-programme director for business and human rights. The massacre by Mozambican forces took place in resource-rich Cabo Delgado province, where government troops were battling violent Islamist militants, linked to the Islamic State group, with a gruesome reputation for beheading victims. In March 2021,Islamists attacked the besieged town of Palma, where they killed or  kidnapped 1,563 civilians living next to TotalEnergies gas plant on Mozambique's remote northern Afungi peninsula, according to Alex Perry. The investigative journalist first documented the Palma death toll, and the subsequentreprisal massacre at the entrance to Total's compound, for Politico in 2024. Perry called it the \"bloodiest disaster in oil and gas history\". Locals who sought help from the forces at the Total facility were accused of aiding the insurgents. Men were separated from the group by force and held in shipping containers. The exact number of civilians subsequently killed by Mozambican  forces providing security for Total is not clear. Perry identified 97 victims but estimates the true figure could be double that. \"Most people have never heard about any of this, in part because Total has acknowledged none of it. Today is a victory for truth, and accountability,\" Perry told the BBC. The BBC has contacted TotalEnergies for comment. The British government initially offered financial guarantees for UK companies seeking to take part in what was heralded as an unprecedented opportunity for economic development in Mozambique. But after suspending support following the bloodshed in Palma, Britain is now being urged to walk away by environmental campaigners, who say the gravity of the allegations against Total must be a \"red line\" for the financial backers of its liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Mozambique. Total continued to \"demonstrate that it has learned nothing from the past: it just announced the lifting of the force majeure on its gas project, despite the dramatic security and humanitarian situation\", Lorette Philippot from Friends of the Earth France said. The UK and Dutch governments must \"refuse to renew their financial support and withdraw from Mozambique LNG\", she added, like French banks Société Générale and Crédit Agricole. Supporters of TotalEnergies' determination to proceed with the vast project in Cabo Delgado say it is a bold investment that could bring huge rewards to a neglected region of Africa. But critics say it is an environmental, ethical and financial disaster. They draw links between Total's actions and struggles and those of another giant French company, Lafarge, which went on trial in France this month, along with eight former employees, over allegations that itpaid jihadist groups in Syria to keep a cement plant there in operation."}

Children, families will perish,\" says Jan Egeland, Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC). \"It's actually so frustrating that we've now lost so many crucial weeks since the adoption of the Trump peace plan, which said humanitarian aid would flow and the Palestinians would not needlessly continue to suffer.\" With a majority of the population displaced by two-years of a devastating war, most Gazans now live in tents - many of them makeshift. They have been clearing up after widespread flooding due to a winter storm that began on Friday. There are fears that diseases could spread as rainwater has mixed with sewage water. \"My children are already sick and look at what happened to our tent,\" said Fatima Hamdona, crying in the rain over the weekend, as she showed a BBC freelance journalist the ankle-deep puddle inside her temporary home in Gaza City. \"We don't have food - the flour got all wet.  We're people who've been destroyed.  Where do we go? There's no shelter for us to go to now.\" The story was the same in the southern city of Khan Younis. \"Our clothes, mattresses and blankets were flooded,\" said Nihad Shabat, as she tried to dry out her possessions there on Monday. Her family has been sleeping inside a shelter made of sheets and blankets. \"We're worried about getting flooded again. We cannot afford to buy a tent.\" A recent UN report found that across Gazamore than 80% of buildings had been destroyed and 92% in Gaza City. According to the NRC - which has long led the so-called Shelter Cluster in Gaza, made up of some 20 non-governmental organisations (NGOs) - about 260,000 Palestinian families, or about 1.5 million people, are in need of emergency shelter assistance, lacking the basics to get through winter. The NGOs say they have been able to get only about 19,000 tents into Gaza since the US-brokered Israel-Hamas ceasefire took effect on 10 October. They say they have 4,000 pallets of aid - containing non-food items, including tents and bedding - blocked from entering.  Supplies that have been bought are currently stuck in Egypt, Jordan and Israel. Jan Egeland blames what he calls \"a bureaucratic, military, politicised quagmire\" running \"counter to all humanitarian principles\" for the hold-up. In March, Israel introduced a new registration process for aid groups working in Gaza, citing security reasons.  It requires that they give lists of their local Palestinian staff. However, aid groups say that data protection laws in donor countries prevent them from handing over such information. Many items, including tent poles, are also classed as \"dual-use\" by Israel, meaning they have a military as well as civilian purpose, and their entry is banned or heavily restricted. Cogat, the Israeli defence body that controls the border crossings, told the BBC that \"over the last few months\" it had coordinated the entry of \"close to 190,000 tents and tarpaulins directly to the residents of the Gaza Strip\". It said that \"in accordance with the terms of the agreement\" of the ceasefire, it was allowing \"hundreds of trucks carrying food, water, fuel, gas, medicines, medical equipment, tents, and shelter supplies [to] enter the Gaza Strip every day, in coordination with the UN, international organizations, donor countries, and the private sector\". On Sunday, Cogat wrote on X: \"We call on international organizations to coordinate more tents and tarpaulins and other winter humanitarian responses.\" It said it was working with the new US-led Civil-Military Coordination Center (CMCC) that had been set up in southern Israel and other international partners to plan \"a catered humanitarian response for the upcoming winter\". International aid groups are hoping that the CMCC - which will oversee implementation of President Trump's 20-point Gaza peace plan - will help ease restrictions on their work. With a foreign donor conference on reconstruction in the Palestinian territory expected to take place in Egypt soon, they say basic shelter supplies must be allowed to enter while longer-term plans are developed. \"It would not be a good thing if all these nations meet in Cairo to discuss long-term reconstruction for Palestinians in great need if they die before their high-rise buildings can be reconstructed,\" says Mr Egeland, who was previously the UN's Emergency Relief Coordinator. \"They need a tent today, they don't need a promise of a beachfront structure in five years.\" Palestinians have told the BBC that many tents - brought in by international agencies and Gulf donors - have been stolen and are available on the black market in Gaza. They say that with a small increase in supply, prices have dropped from about $2,700 (2,330 euros; £2,050) before the ceasefire, to around $900-$1,000. There are pleas for international help to distribute more shelters, more fairly. \"I hope everyone will join with us to end this crisis we're living through,\" says Alaa al-Dirghali in Khan Younis.  \"The tents endured two years under the sun and two years under the rain and they couldn't last this downpour.\" \"Until this moment, people are re-erecting these broken tents because they don't have any alternative.  I pray to God that those responsible for handing out tents will give them to those who actually need them.  They're getting stolen and sold to people at a very expensive price.\" In Gaza City, Rami Deif Allah, who was displaced from Beit Hanoun, was drying out soaked mattresses in the weak sunshine, with his elderly mother and children. He said a relative had given him a waterproof tent but that it was still flooded. \"We evacuated about 11 times and there was no safe place for us so we took shelter in these humble tents but it was all in vain. When the rain came they couldn't protect us,\" he said. \"The water flooded us from above and below.\" Like all Gazans, Rami longs for a permanent dwelling. \"We pray for this war to be fully over, and for everyone to return to their homes,\" he went on.  \"Even if we don't find our houses standing, with our sweat and blood we will rebuild. This situation of living out on the streets is unbearable.\" Correction 18 November 2025: An earlier version of this article mistakenly said NGO said 44,000 pallets of aid were being blocked from entering Gaza. The correct figure is 4,000."}

And now researchers have reconstructed the evolutionary origins of kissing. Their study suggests that the mouth-on-mouth kiss evolved more than 21 million years ago, and was something that the common ancestor of humans and other great apes probably indulged in. The same research concluded that Neanderthals may have kissed too – and that humans and Neanderthals may even have smooched one another. The scientists studied kissing because it presents something of an evolutionary puzzle - it has no obvious survival or reproductive benefits, and yet it is something that is seen not just in many human societies, but across the animal kingdom. By finding evidence of other animals engaging in kissing, scientists were able to construct an \"evolutionary family tree\" to work out when it was most likely to have evolved. To ensure that they were comparing the same behaviour across different species, the researchers had to give a very precise - rather unromantic - definition to a \"kiss\". In their study,published in the journal Evolution and Human Behaviour, they defined kissing as non aggressive, directed oral-oral contact \"with some movement of lips or mouthparts and no food transfer\". \"Humans, chimps, and bonobos all kiss,\" explained lead researcher Dr Matilda Brindle, an evolutionary biologist from the University of Oxford. From that, she concluded, \"it's likely that their most recent common ancestor kissed.\" \"We think kissing probably evolved around 21.5 million years ago in the large apes.\" In this study, scientists found behaviour that matched their scientific definition of kissing in wolves, prairie dogs, polar bears (very sloppy - lots of tongue), and even albatrosses. They focused on primates - and apes in particular - in order to build an evolutionary picture of the origin of the human kiss. The same study also concluded that Neanderthals - our closest ancient human relatives that died out around 40,000 years ago - also kissed. One previouspiece of research on Neanderthal DNAalso showed that modern humans and Neanderthals shared an oral microbe - a type of bacteria found in our saliva. \"That means that they must have been swapping saliva for hundreds of thousands of years after the two species split,\" explained Dr Brindle. While this study pinpointed when kissing evolved it was not able to answer the question of why. There are already a number of theories - that itarose from grooming behaviourin our ape ancestors or that it might provide an intimate way toassess the health and even the compatibilityof a partner. Dr Brindle hopes that this will open a door to answering that question. \"It's important for us to understand that this is something we share with our non-human relatives,\" she said. \"We should be studying this behaviour, not just dismissing it as silly because it has romantic connotations in humans.\""}

The sleeve partnership began in 2018 and the current deal is reportedly worth more than £10m ($13.3m) per year. But it has come under the spotlight after increased violence in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, which borders Rwanda, though the framework of a peace deal between Rwandan-backed M23 rebels and the Congolese government was signed earlier this week. In April, Paris St-Germain extended their sponsorship with Visit Rwanda until 2028, while Atletico Madridsigned a three-year dealto carry the logo on their men's and women's shirts this season. DR Congo and M23 rebels sign framework for peace in Qatar What's the fighting in DR Congo all about? Arsenal urged to put Visit Rwanda 'financial gains' aside In a statement,,externalArsenal said the club and the Rwanda development board had \"mutually agreed\" to end the deal. The Gunners added it had \"exceeded the original goals of the partnership\", which were to promote conservation and sustainable tourism while also supporting Rwanda's ambition \"to become an international sporting hub in Africa\". Richard Garlick, Arsenal's chief executive officer said the partnership had played an important role in helping the Gunners \"invest in our long-term vision to win major trophies, in a financially sustainable way\". In February, DR Congo appealed to Arsenal, PSG and Bayern Munich, who are also sponsored by Visit Rwanda, to end their\"blood stained\"deals amid a worsening humanitarian crisis in the country. A campaign group named Gunners for Peace protested outside Emirates Stadium during the first leg of the Champions League semi-final tie with PSG last season, with a banner that read 'Drop Visit Rwanda', and distributed armbands to cover up the Visit Rwanda logo on kits. The group also made a spoof video urging fans to 'Visit Tottenham', Arsenal's north London rivals, instead, to highlight the need for a sponsor \"that better fits the values of the club\". Gunners for Peace posted onInstagram,externalthe news of the deal ending showed Arsenal \"still has the class and the values to do the right thing\", adding: \"We all know that money talks, but if fans get together and speak louder then they have to listen.\" Campaigners put up a sign that read 'Visit Tottenham' outside the Emirates Stadium in April Analysis by Rob Stevens, BBC Sport Africa senior journalist The news that Arsenal's Visit Rwanda partnership will finish by mutual agreement at the end of this season has been celebrated by campaigners as a victory for fan power. Repeated protests by Gunners for Peace may have had an impact on the Premier League club's decision, but whether the sums involved still added up for Rwanda is another matter. A Rwanda Development Board spokesperson said it was \"proud\" of a partnership that \"broke new ground for tourism boards\". Visit Rwanda will retain a strong presence at the top of the European game over the next few years via its sponsorships of PSG and Atletico Madrid. The brand is also making its way into markets in the United States after announcing long-term deals with the NFL's Los Angeles Rams and NBA side LA Clippers back in September. DR Congo's government has criticised the Rwanda Development Board's partnerships, but has followed its neighbour by agreeing its own four-year deal with FC Barcelona to promote the country. While those high-profile deals have garnered attention, hopes are that the recently-agreed framework for peace between DRC and the M23 will end decades of conflict in the resource-rich region.

The designation means the areas, including one in part of the Amazon, will have their culture and environment protected under Brazilian law - though this is not always enforced. The move follows similar actions from President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, whose government recognised Indigenous possession of 11 territories last year. \"Each and every indigenous territory in Brazil is a reason to celebrate and is a reason for us to feel happy,\" Dinaman Tuxá from the group Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil (APIB) told the BBC at COP30. The latest measure will be formalised through a presidential decree. Mr Tuxá said APIB wants more lands to be recognised legally, giving groups the right to control what happens to the land within the borders. \"Indigenous peoples today protect 82% of the world's biodiversity. If you demarcate indigenous lands, you guarantee this area will be protected,\" he said. \"The traditional way of life of indigenous peoples protects the lands and automatically guarantees global warming will be tackled. Consequently the entire humanity benefits from it,\" he added. Some indigenous groups are attacked when they try to defend their land from cattle ranchers or groups trying to cut down trees for agriculture. On Sunday an indigenous leader from the Guarani Kaiowá community in the south of Brazil was killed during an attack, according to Survival International. Vicente Fernandes Vilhalva, 36, was shot in the head when gunmen surrounded the village, according to eyewitnesses who spoke to Survival International. Thousands protested on Saturday outside the UN's annual climate conference, with some carrying signs reading \"demarcation now\". And last week, demonstrators - some of whom were from Indigenous groups - carrying signs that read \"our forests are not for sale\" broke into the summit and tussled with security. Security around the conference has since increased noticeably, with more armed soldiers and police at the entrance. Lots of Indigenous groups do not have accreditation to go inside. But this remains the COP with the highest number of representatives from indigenous groups. \"This makes me very happy. We worked for two years and now we have at least 900 people inside the COP where they can negotiate and represent their communities,\" Kleber Karipuna, from APIB, told BBC News. More than 200 human rights groups wrote to UN officials on Monday criticising the enhanced security, saying it \"contributes to an increasing global trend towards the silencing of dissent, militarised response to protest, and marginalisation of those defending land and the environment\". Past recognition of Indigenous reservesbanned mining and logging, as well as restricting commercial farming, in the areas they covered to prevent deforestation. Expanding the total area considered Indigenous territory could prevent up to 20% of additional deforestation and reduce carbon emissions by 26% by 2030, according to a study by the Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil, the Amazon Environmental Research Institute and the Indigenous Climate Change Committee. The new protected areas span hundreds of thousands of hectares and are inhabited by thousands of people from the Mura, Tupinambá de Olivença, Pataxó, Guarani-Kaiowá, Munduruku, Pankará, and Guarani-Mbya indigenous peoples. One area overlaps more than 78% with the Amazon National Park, part of the bio-diverse rainforest which plays a crucial role in regulating the global climate and storing carbon. The Brazilian government's announcement came on Indigenous Peoples' Day at COP30 on Monday. Until the left-wing Lula re-entered office, no new Indigenous lands had been declared since 2018, it said. Under his far-right predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro, who promoted mining on Indigenous lands, the protections afforded to them were frequently not enforced. Lula's governmenthas previously taken actionto drive out illegal miners from indigenous lands. Currently, Indigenous lands encompass 117.4 million hectares - roughly equivalent to the size of Colombia, or around 13.8% of Brazil's territory. Hundreds of Indigenous groups live in Brazil, according to the country's census. The Amazon rainforest is already at riskof a renewed surge in deforestation as efforts grow to overturn a key ban to protect it. Thick and healthy forestry helps pull carbon out of the atmosphere. Carbon released through the burning of fossil fuels has contributed to climate change. Countries are gathering at COP30 in an effort to reach agreements on how to try to limit global average temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels and keep them \"well below\" 2C. The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says a large body of scientific evidence shows that warming of 2C or more would bring serious consequences, including extreme heat, higher sea levels and threats to food security."}

Bulldozers are clearing roads, shovelling the detritus of war into waiting trucks. Mountains of rubble and twisted metal are on either side, the remains of once bustling neighbourhoods. Parts of Gaza City are disfigured beyond recognition. \"This was my house,\" says Abu Iyad Hamdouna. He points to a mangled heap of concrete and steel in Sheikh Radwan, which was once one of Gaza City's most densely populated neighbourhoods. \"It was here. But there's no house left.\" Abu Iyad is 63. If Gaza ever rises from the ashes, he doesn't expect to be around to see it. \"At this rate, I think it'll take 10 years.\" He looks exhausted and resigned. \"We'll be dead... we'll die without seeing reconstruction.\" Nearby, 43-year-old Nihad al-Madhoun and his nephew Said are picking through the wreckage of what was once a home. The building might well collapse but it doesn't deter them - they collect old breeze blocks and brush thick dust off an old red sofa. \"The removal of rubble alone might take more than five years,\" he says. \"And we will wait. We have no other option.\" The sheer scale of the challenge is staggering. The UN estimates the cost of damage at £53bn ($70bn). Almost 300,000 houses and apartments have beendamaged or destroyed, according to the UN's satellite centre Unosat. The Gaza Strip is littered with 60 million tonnes of rubble, mixed in with dangerous unexploded bombs and dead bodies. In all, more than 68,000 people have been killed in Gaza in the past two years, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Its figures are accepted by the United Nations and other international bodies. In the midst of such destruction, it's hard to know where to begin. There's no shortage of ideas - including grand designs conceived by those with money and power in faraway capitals. The US President Donald Trump had his say too. But Gazans we spoke to are sceptical of schemes drawn up abroad, and they have visions of their own. So the fight is on to shape Gaza's future. The question is, who will prevail? Yahya al-Sarraj, Gaza City's Hamas-appointed mayor, is out on the streets wearing a hi-vis jacket and surveying the ruins. Already, shops and restaurants are starting to reopen, he points out. \"Of course it's very modest,\" he says, \"but they want to live, and they deserve to live.\" Gaza is no stranger to these destructions, he adds, recalling several conflicts prior to the cataclysm that erupted, following the devastating attack that Hamas launched on Israel on 7 October 2023. \"We heard about a lot of plans, international, local, regional plans. [But] we have our own plan. \"We call it the Phoenix of Gaza.\" This was the first home-grown Palestinian plan to emerge during the war - in a computer-generated video that accompanied it, shattered communities are seen transformed, as if by magic, into modern neighbourhoods. \"We wanted to fill the vacuum,\" says Yara Salem, a former senior manager at World Bank with 30 years of experience in conflict areas, including post-war Iraq. \"You cannot have foreign-imposed reconstruction plans while you don't have any vision about your own country.\" The publication of the Phoenix plan in February followed 13 months of work by a broad coalition of around 700 Palestinian reconstruction experts, some based abroad. It drew on the knowledge and experience of architects and engineers across the Gaza Strip too. Students at Birzeit University in the occupied West Bank were also involved as the idea evolved. Hamas, which exercises political control over the municipalities, was not involved. Today, the creators of the Phoenix plan know that its fate is out of their hands, as competing interests, in the Middle East and beyond, jostle for control of Gaza's future. This vision stands in sharp contrast to the glitzy \"Gaza Riviera\", a controversial proposal first described in February by President Trump during a meeting with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House. Trump famously reposted a bizarre AI-generated video on his social media account, showing himself, Netanyahu and billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk enjoying the high life in a kind of Dubai-style fantasy. A giant golden statue of the president towered over a street and bearded male belly dancers wearing green headbands were pictured on the beach. Though the video was clearly a spoof, President Trump had already spoken of the US taking \"a long-term ownership position\" in Gaza. \"Gaza's waterfront property could be very valuable,\" his son-in-law Jared Kushner told an audience at Harvard University last year, \"if people would focus on building up livelihoods.\" Trump's20-point Gaza ceasefire proposal,agreed in October, also includes references to a \"Trump economic development plan to rebuild and energise Gaza\", alongside an international \"Board of Peace\" to oversee governance - there has been speculation about whether former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair could end up at its helm. But Trump's \"Gaza Riviera\" is not the only glossy vision of a futuristic Gaza that has emerged. A leaked document, published in August by The Washington Post, painted a similar vision of a high-tech Gaza Strip, under US trusteeship for 10 years. Dubbed the Gaza Reconstitution, Economic Acceleration and Transformation Trust - \"Great\" for short – the plan was said to be the work of Israeli and American consultants, with input from members of Tony Blair's Institute for Global Change. The plan envisaged the creation of a series of \"modern and AI-powered smart planned cities\", noting that poor urban design lay at the heart of \"Gaza's ongoing insurgency.\" \"From a Demolished Iranian Proxy to a Prosperous Abrahamic Ally,\" the plan's subtitle read, in a nod to theAbraham Accordsbrokered during Trump's first presidential term, suggesting that a revived Gaza could form part of a much larger regional peace initiative. The plan also nodded to the idea of \"voluntary relocation,\" under which a quarter of Gaza's population would leave the Strip, in return for a $5,000 (£3,780) relocation package and subsidised rent abroad. It all stands in sharp contrast to the Phoenix plan that sets out to protect Gaza's existing infrastructure and, where possible, restore the area's social and geographical fabric. \"These sort of almost hallucinatory plans are creating an opening for disaster capitalism that is worrying,\" argues Raja Khalidi, director general of the Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute, an independent think tank. \"The state has the ability to plan… what sort of Gaza we want to build, and when we want to build it and how much it's going to cost us. \"It has to be a Palestinian vision - my concern [is that] we will be sidelined.\" Shelly Culbertson, a senior researcher at the US-based RAND non-partisan think tank and co-author of a detailed study on Gaza reconstruction, also believes that the Gaza Strip is not simply a blank slate waiting to be turned into a new version of Dubai. \"There's a lot of heritage, cities that have been around for… millennia,\" she says. \"It's not good practice to just wipe it all out and start over, but rather build with what you have.\" These are not the only plans however. Another, drafted by Egypt and adopted hastily by the Arab League at a summit in Cairo in March, spoke of rebuilding Gaza over a period of five years  - like the Phoenix plan, it emphasised the importance of involving Gazans in every stage \"to foster a sense of ownership and ensure that the needs of the local community are met\". Meanwhile the Palestinian Authority (PA), led by President Mahmoud Abbas, has been developing its own proposals for the Gaza Strip, as part of a wider plan to reconnect Gaza and the occupied West Bank in a future Palestinian state. At his office in Ramallah, Estephan Salameh, the PA planning minister told me that whatever plan is settled upon, Gaza of the future would look different, but that some things would have to stay the same. \"Don't forget that 70% of Gaza's population are Palestinian refugees,\" he says. \"And we need to preserve the refugee identity. We need to preserve the soul and the spirit of Gaza.\" For Salameh, that means recreating Gaza's pre-war refugee camps, where hundreds of thousands of descendants of Palestinians, who fled or were driven from their homes in the war surrounding Israel's creation in 1948-9, have lived ever since. Over time, the camps have evolved, from the canvas tents and tin shacks of the 1950s into busy, overcrowded communities with some of the highest population densities in the world. The PA plan is not to recreate slums, but to make sure that tight-knit communities can be restored. \"We want to have Jabalia rebuilt where it was,\" Salameh says, referring to the biggest camp that was once home to more than 100,000 people, and that is now largely destroyed. But for the time being, the Palestine Authority's rule only extends to the West Bank, not Gaza. Trump's Gaza ceasefire plan says the Board of Peace will handle Gaza's redevelopment \"until such time as the Palestinian Authority has completed its reform programme\". Reconstruction is likely to be a slow, painstaking process, one that Shelly Culbertson calls \"incremental urbanism\". \"Living in the damaged but habitable communities and rebuilding while in them, we think is going to be a key way of preserving communities and allowing people to move back,\" she says. \"[But] some places have been so destroyed and damaged and dangerous that the only thing to do really is wall them off, raze them and completely rebuild. \"This is not going to be a five-year recovery - it's probably going to take decades.\" The Palestinian Authority's planning minister predicts a quicker timeline but says nothing can begin until political and security arrangements are in place, borders are open (to allow the import of building materials) and funding is secured. But therein lies the rub. In order for international donors to pledge the tens of billions of dollars needed to rebuild Gaza, there has to be agreement on what a recovery plan will look like. Egypt plans to hold a reconstruction summit but a date has not yet been set. And the most likely funders - Saudi Arabia and the UAE - will need reassurances that their colossal investments are not simply going to go up in smoke in some future Gaza war. But with the current Israeli government strongly opposing the creation of a Palestinian state - something that Saudi Arabia is also pushing for - the political obstacles are formidable. Israel has previously said that it is not opposed to investors and builders from a variety of countries beginning efforts to rebuild in areas controlled by the IDF. On a recent visit to Israel, Jared Kushner spoke of building \"a new Gaza\" on territory still under Israeli military control, saying no reconstruction funds would go to areas controlled by Hamas. But nothing substantial can happen while the Gaza ceasefire hangs by a thread, and Israel and Hamas still trade occasional blows. Back in the shattered remains of Gaza City's Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood, Abu Iyad Hamdouna has more immediate concerns. \"Reconstruction?\" he exclaims. \"What about water?\" After five forced displacements during the war, Abu Iyad just wants to stay put, in whatever shelter he can find, or make for himself. He's not waiting for the Phoenix to rise or indeed for any sort of Gaza Riviera to materialise. \"Here we are, making tents,\" he says. \"We are sitting making tents, next to the house we still cannot live in.\" Lead image credit: Bloomberg/Reuters/ Phoenix.

Smith, 36, is one of the best batters of the modern era and averages 56.01 in Ashes cricket with 12 hundreds. The right-hander, who has played in every Ashes series since 2010-11, was the leading run-scorer in the 2017-18 and 2019 contests - with 687 and 774 runs respectively - when former bowler Broad was in England's ranks. \"I remember he got this big two hundred [239 in Perth in 2017] and I did not miss the middle of his bat for three days,\" Broad said onthe For the Love of Cricket podcast. \"Every ball I tried to bowl just hit the middle of his bat. \"He's got that mindset of 'OK, this pitch suits me, and I'm not getting out'.\" Broad dismissed Smith 11 times in Tests - three more than any other bowler - but is no closer to settling on a weakness. Smith's career average of 56.02 rises to 59.70 when batting at home. Only the great Ricky Ponting (41) has scored more than Smith's 36 Test centuries for Australia. Broad said: \"Obviously [Smith's] technique's changed throughout, but I still can't sit here and go 'well this is how you get him out'. \"That's an unbelievable strength of his. He's incredibly difficult to bowl at. Sometimes you don't feel like you've bowled a bad ball and it still goes for four.\" 'It felt like God's hand on my brain' - the day England were humbled by teenager 'Rapid' Wood bowls in nets to boost Test hopes How much do you know about past Australia-England games in Perth? Smith's form dipped slightly between June 2023 and December 2024 when he went 23 innings without a Test hundred, but he made two against India last winter and hit 141 and 131 against Sri Lanka at the start of 2025. After a two-month break, he began his build-up to this year's Ashes in late October and scored 118 in his first innings. \"To win the series, we have to keep him [his average] to under 50, don't we?\" Broad said. \"He's gonna score a hundred, it's what he does. \"[If] he averages 40, that's at least 15 under his career average, so you're doing brilliantly. I think you have to get him early. \"If England aren't celebrating in his first 40 runs, it's going to be a long series.\" England have had various plans to counter Smith's unconventional technique over 14 years of Ashes series. Broad spoke of developing a new outswinger for Smith before the 2023 series while England have targeted Smith's pads, bowled wide of off stump and even bowled for catches at leg gully in 2019 - a series Smith began with twin hundreds at Edgbaston. \"I remember Jason Roy was fielding there at leg gully, and he was diving left and right for the first 30 balls, just missing him there, just missing him there,\" Broad said. \"Smith got away, got two hundreds in that game, unbelievable innings.\" Broad added: \"I remember sitting in a bowlers' meeting about Steve Smith in 2017-18 and they were like 'oh, you could try and attack his stumps early'. \"'Oh yeah, can we just click on how many times he's been bowled in Australia in the last five years?' Once.\" The upcoming series, which begins in Perth on Friday (02:30 GMT), looks set to see Smith face Jofra Archer for the first time in Tests since 2019, when he was famously unsettled and struck by a bouncer during the England paceman's fierce spell at Lord's. Smith has always been keen to point out Archer did not dismiss him in that Test - he had to retire hurt and was out lbw to Chris Woakes on his return - though Archer did have the right-hander caught on the pull in a one-day international in 2024. \"Can Jofra Archer be that guy?\" Broad said. \"Nicking him off from back of a length, just chasing it. \"Because Jofra Archer has that angle of nipping back towards the stumps, can he nip one away? Smith's looking for the nip-backer.\""}

They are now seventh in the Premier League, two points behind third-placed Chelsea. After two woeful seasons, optimism is growing around Old Trafford that United are moving in the right direction. Yet it is only just over four years ago they finished second under manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, scoring 73 goals, the most in a single campaign since Sir Alex Ferguson's era ended in 2013. After four matches of the 2021-22 season they were top, with three wins and a draw from their opening four games. Is it time to reappraise Solskjaer's time as Manchester United boss? The Ratcliffe revolution - inside Man Utd's exodus and rebuild Big questions for Man Utd and Spurs, as Reds wait on Sesko injury Why are Man Utd not playing on a Saturday for two months? Ole Gunnar Solskjaer won 91 out of 168 games as Manchester United manager, a win rate of 54.2% There is a cruel narrative around Solskjaer. It is that, after spells with Molde, where he won the Norwegian title, and Cardiff, where he was relegated, the 52-year-old was lucky to be appointed interim United manager following Jose Mourinho's dismissal in December 2018. Then, that he should never have beengiven the permanent role, let alone get an extension and that his shortcomings were eventually exposed as he lost his job following a disastrous 4-1 defeat at Watford that ended a terrible sequence of results including a5-0 home defeat by Liverpool. But is that assessment just cherry-picking the negatives? Speaking to people involved in Solskjaer's appointment - and dismissal - there is a more positive view. \"He is absolutely far better than many people give him credit for,\" said a source who observed Solskjaer at close quarters throughout his near three-year tenure. In the wake of Mourinho's dismissal, executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward called Solskjaer back to the club he had served so memorably as a player and a coach with a simple brief - bring a smile back to Old Trafford. When Solskjaer walked back into the Carrington training ground he knew so well and where he was so popular he headed straight to beloved receptionist Kath Phipps and gave her a hug and a kiss and some of her favourite chocolates. He turned up unexpectedly at the staff Christmas party. Those who were there say the reception he received was akin to that of an A-list celebrity. The impact went further and deeper. By nature, Solskjaer is a positive person. \"An optimist to the limit,\" said a former colleague. \"He sees good in everything. \"It was tiny things, like saying 'good morning, how are you doing?' Being human basically. Everything had been on a downer and was very flat. People weren't being themselves. He opened the door and got them to smile again.\" Solskjaer, it is stressed, was not turning the club back to the Ferguson era. But he felt there were elements of the Scot's regime that could work in the modern era. He was big on standards. Dress code on away trips was altered as blazers and ties returned. Carrington became more inclusive. Access to the club canteen was widened. The general mood became lighter and more upbeat, helped by a sensational run of eight wins in a row at the start of his reign, which extended to 14 victories, two draws and one defeat in his first 17 games. That defeat was avenged when Unitedwent to Paris St-Germain and beat them 2-1thanks to Marcus Rashford's stoppage-time penalty. It was a result that ranks high on the list of the club's European achievements, to reach the Champions League quarter-finals, something they have only managed twice since they were beaten by Barcelona at Wembley in the 2011 final. Against that backdrop, Solskjaer became permanent manager, signing a three-year contract. His critics say this was a mistake. Those involved in the negotiations still argue otherwise. \"People spoke about his philosophy, but training was led by Kieran [McKenna],\" an insider told the BBC. \"Ole was on the grass but he watched the coaching. In that sense, his methods were similar to Carlo Ancelotti. \"He was brilliant at man-managing the players. The culture was incredible. He was a confidante. The players wanted to play for him, and the style of football was what everyone wanted.\" After a sixth-place finish in that initial season, United ended Solskjaer's two full campaigns in third and second - the highest consecutive league positions since Ferguson retired. They reached five semi-finals out of six in cup competitions. Crucially though, they did not win any. The nearest they came waslosing on penalties to Villarrealin the 2021 Europa League final when goalkeeper David de Gea's missed spot-kick proved decisive. The lack of silverware was a problem. \"It was like an albatross he carried,\" said the insider. \"Particularly in the second full year, people kept saying 'will he win something?'.\" Despite this, internally there was belief in Solskjaer and his team. In July 2021 he wasgiven a contract extension to 2024. Woodward said the foundations were now in place \"for long-term success\". Cristiano Ronaldo's return was added to the big-money arrivals of Jadon Sancho and Raphael Varane - and thePortugal superstar then scored twiceon his second debut against Newcastle to send Manchester United top of the Premier League. The mood was euphoric. It proved to be the ultimate false dawn. BBC Sport has been told the United dressing room, almost exclusively, was thrilled by Ronaldo's arrival. Solskjaer felt the returning forward would set standards and show team-mates what was required to reach the top. Ferguson wanted him. Woodward wanted him. The fans wanted him. \"The problem was the way Ole and Kieran set the team out, you couldn't carry too many players who didn't track back,\" said a dressing room source. \"It needed legs, it needed press. \"The system had to change, which is fine to accommodate a big player, but Ole couldn't make it work. Ronaldo was effective but his arrival took something quite major out of a system he had been working on for two and a half years.\" It unravelled in the space of six defeats in 11 games over two months, including that astonishing home defeat by Liverpool. Losing at Watford - United conceded twice in stoppage time -proved to be the end. There are those who think that was unfair. \"That game was a mess,\" said the dressing room source. \"The scoreline suggested everything had gone wrong. \"It hadn't but that is when you need backing. The usual noise about 'losing the dressing room' started. He never did. He might have lost one or two players but usually they are the ones not getting picked.\" Solskjaer privately knew his time was up and the last rites on his tenure came in a short and emotional meeting with Woodward the following morning. \"Maybe Ole would have solved it eventually but he didn't in those first few months and the club was falling into a bad place,\" says someone with knowledge of the decision-making process. As it turned out, first under the interim charge of Michael Carrick, then Ralf Rangnick, with the same group of players United won 10 and lost just two of their next 18 games. Could Solskjaer have engineered that same turnaround in fortunes? No-one will ever know. But, looking back, maybe his time in charge was not so bad after all.

The six-hectare (15-acre) campus sits in the heart of Benin City, capital of the southern state of Edo - and includes an archaeological dig and buildings designed by high-profile British-Ghanaian architect Sir David Adjaye, best known for the National Museum of African American History and Culture that opened in Washington in 2016. It has been five years in the making - and is envisioned to celebrate both the past and the present in the region famous for the Benin Bronzes, artworks looted from the city's royal palace by British soldiers in the 19th Century. It is impressive - and ahead of the planned opening, Mowaa was buzzing with staff determined to prove it is a place that can rival established museums and galleries in the West. Inside conservators carefully unwrapped artworks from protective packaging, inspecting each piece and taking meticulous records before positioning them on walls and plinths. Technicians fine-tuned climate control systems. In the materials science laboratory, officers calibrated equipment meant to preserve centuries-old artefacts. The project has been the brainchild of businessman Phillip Ihenacho - now Mowaa's executive director. \"I want us to have a significant economic impact on communities around here,\" he told the BBC, adding that he hoped to make Benin City \"a cultural destination\". Mowaa, a non-profit Nigerian institution, sees itself creating more than 30,000 direct and indirect jobs and contributing more than $80m (£60m) annually to the regional creative economy through partnerships and programming. It has taken $25m (£19m) to get here - money raised from various donors, including the French and German governments, the British Museum and the Edo state government. But now the local government has pulled the rug from under it - revoking the use of the land on which the museum was built. An Edo state spokesperson told the BBC this was because in the original paperwork it had called itself Edo Museum of West African Art - and it had since dropped \"Edo\" from its name. This announcement followed protests on Sunday, when people stormed the campus demanding it be called the Benin Royal Museum. A rowdy group insulted foreign guests at the museum ahead of the opening - forcing them to be hurried away under police escort. President Bola Tinubu has even stepped in to try and resolve the tensions, setting up a high-level committee to do some damage control. But how has this become so politicised - and such a PR disaster? Much of it comes down to internecine rivalries at a local state level, as it was Edo's previous governor Godwin Obaseki - whose term in office ended last year - who was a major backer of the museum. And it seems the administration of the new governor, a close ally of the local traditional ruler, known as the Oba, may want more of a stake in the project. The protesters on Sunday, for example, were demanding that the museum be placed under the control of Oba Ewuare II. This brings into focus the contentious issue of the Benin Bronzes, one of Africa's most celebrated cultural treasures. Because even if the museum does eventually open, these bronzes will be conspicuously absent. They are brass, ivory and wooden sculptures that once adorned the royal palace of the Benin Kingdom before British soldiers looted them in 1897 during a punitive expedition. Today, thousands remain scattered across museums in Europe and North America -- including the British Museum, Berlin's Humboldt Forum and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Their return has become one of the most contested debates in the global art world. About 150 have now made their way home - and more are due to follow. When plans for the museum in Benin City were first announced in 2019, the movers and shakers on Nigeria's art scene hoped it would become their natural home - a state-of-the-art complex to show them off to the world. But the waters were muddied two years ago after the federal government announced that the Oba would be the rightful owner and custodian of any returned bronzes - and the palace pushed for a museum under the royal family's direct control, against the wishes of Obaseki, the former governor. This left Mowaa in a delicate position: asserting a clear stance on restitution while remaining diplomatic on custodianship - and emphasising its broader vision, which led to it dropping \"Edo\" from its name. \"One of the frustrations I've always had is that from the beginning we have said we will be about the modern and contemporary,\" said Mr Ihenacho. \"But because of the Western story about the return of the Benin Bronzes, everyone kept referring to us as the museum where they will go. The problem with that is we are not the owners, nor do we have any legal title to the bronzes.\" His goal is to build a haven for contemporary African creativity, including film, photography, music, dance and fashion - not just visual art. \"Yes, we want to focus on the historical, but the purpose is to inspire the contemporary,\" he said. \"What we have become is a museum that is really about creating an ecosystem to support creatives in West Africa.\" From a young Nigerian artist who relocated from the US to work as a conservator, to a recent graduate undergoing his one-year mandatory national youth service programme, to a Ghanaian PhD candidate conducting research, Mowaa has already become a hub of regional collaboration. A sculpture graduate from the University of Benin who has had a tour of Mowaa, welcomed this opportunity. The graduate, who did not want to be named, noted that while many residents of the city \"don't care\" about the restitution conversation, the museum still offered something valuable. \"Many of us have never seen the originals, but there we can study their design, technique and history more closely,\" he told the BBC. Cultural specialist Oluwatoyin Sogbesan agrees that the conversation has grown increasingly elitist. \"The everyday person is concerned about making a living, going to work, and feeding their family. Many don't even know about the bronzes,\" she told the BBC. For her, restitution must move beyond just the return of artefacts to also restore memory and language. \"We need to decolonise the term 'Benin Bronzes' itself,\" she explained. \"Call them by their original Edo name – 'Emwin Arre' [meaning 'Cultural Things'] - what the people who made them would have called them.\" This is something that chimes with the museum's inaugural exhibition - Homecoming - should it open to the public. It features works by acclaimed artists such as Yinka Shonibare, Toyin Ojih Odutola, Precious Okoyomon, and Tunji Adeniyi-Jones - many of whom live in the diaspora and have rarely exhibited in Nigeria. Shonibare's Monument to the Restitution of the Mind and Soul has pride of place - a pyramid-shaped unit featuring more than 150 clay replicas of the Benin Bronzes. \"Creating a monument like this is acknowledging the trauma caused by the looting of those spiritual artefacts,\" he told the BBC. \"It's a deeply emotional engagement with the trauma of the invasion.\" He chose clay deliberately, as a metaphor for connection with the land of Benin itself. \"In the modern world, we seem to have become increasingly distanced from nature, whereas our ancestors had a deep connection and respect for it.\" The pyramid evokes Africa's ancient wonders while the replicas speak to absence and memory. \"The work is conceptual - about the meaning of absence, the spiritual meaning of the bronzes,\" Shonibare explained. \"In a way, the work is cathartic. It is almost mourning.\" Also commanding attention is Ndidi Dike's 2016 mixed-media work National Grid, which reflects on power, both electrical and political. Nigerians experience power outages so frequently they have become an accepted part of daily life - a metaphor Dike uses to question the nation's broader failures in governance and infrastructure. It is something likely to resonate all too well for those working at Mowaa this week. Though they may take heart from the words of the culture minister, who is chairing the presidential committee that wants to resolve the dispute. \"Cultural institutions are pillars of our national identity and must be protected through collaborative approaches that respect both traditional custodianship and modern institutional structures,\" Hannatu Musawa said. There are fears the row may damage ongoing efforts to reclaim Africa's stolen art, with Western museums feeling justified about their concerns over the conservation of returned works. But many working within the walls of Mowaa remain determined to show that their creativity can redefine what a modern African museum can be - with or without historic artefacts.

It will see a train in the Great Western Railway fleet use a hybrid system of both signals from mobile phone masts on the ground and low earth orbit (LEO) satellites in space to create a more reliable connection. The scheme has been developed by British tech company Motion Applied, in partnership with the transport body for Cornwall, Devon, Plymouth, Somerset and Torbay, Peninsula Transport. The pilot will last for 60 days onboard GWR's Intercity Express Train which runs in the South West region, having started in mid-November. Ina recent study by networking testing firm Ookla, the UK ranked 16th out of 18 major European and Asian countries for train wi-fi speed, with average download speeds at just 1.09 megabits per second, compared to Sweden's 64.58. Nick Fry, chairman ofMotion Applied, formerly part of McLaren Group, said the issues faced in connecting to the internet from a fast moving train had \"many parallels with motorsport\". He added that by using technology originally developed for F1 cars, trains should be able to switch between ground and space-based networks such as LEO satellites to \"reliably connect\" without drop outs. In the 2025 spending review, the Department of Transport secured £41m to introduce low earth orbit satellite connectivity on all mainline trains by 2030. Councillor Dan Rogerson, from the Peninsula Transport board, called the pilot a \"major milestone\" in its plans to modernise transport infrastructure across the South West and South Wales. \"It's not just about passenger wi-fi,\" he said. \"This is about a whole new digital backbone for our transport networks\". Bruce Williamson from the campaign group Railfuture told the BBC the scheme appeared to be \"really good news\". \"We're all increasingly connected these days, and wi-fi has become more and more of an essential service for travellers. I'm not going to hold my breath, but this is a step in the right direction.\" In May, South Western Railway launched its own, separate, \"superfast\" wi-fi rollout for its trains between Earlsfield and Basingstoke, using trackside poles and antennas to create a bespoke 5G rail network.

Anthropic said hackers tricked the chatbot into carrying out automated tasks under the guise of carrying out cyber security research. The companyclaimed in a blog postthis was the \"first reported AI-orchestrated cyber espionage campaign\". But sceptics are questioning the accuracy of that claim - and the motive behind it. Anthropic said it discovered the hacking attempts in mid-September. Pretending they were legitimate cyber security workers, hackers gave the chatbot small automated tasks which, when strung together, formed a \"highly sophisticated espionage campaign\". Researchers at Anthropic said they had \"high confidence\" the people carrying out the attacks were \"a Chinese state-sponsored group\". They said humans chose the targets - large tech companies, financial institutions, chemical manufacturing companies, and government agencies – but the company would not be more specific. Hackers then built an unspecified programme using Claude's coding assistance to \"autonomously compromise a chosen target with little human involvement\". Anthropic claims the chatbot was able to successfully breach various unnamed organisations, extract sensitive data and sort through it for valuable information. The company said it had since banned the hackers from using the chatbot and had notified affected companies and law enforcement. But Martin Zugec from cyber firm Bitdefender said the cyber security world had mixed feelings about the news. \"Anthropic's report makes bold, speculative claims but doesn't supply verifiable threat intelligence evidence,\" he said. \"Whilst the report does highlight a growing area of concern, it's important for us to be given as much information as possible about how these attacks happen so that we can assess and define the true danger of AI attacks.\" Anthropic's announcement is perhaps the most high profile example of companies claiming bad actors are using AI tools to carry out automated hacks. It is the kind of danger many have been worried about, but other AI companies have also claimed that nation state hackers have used their products. In February 2024, OpenAI published a blog post in collaboration with cyber experts from Microsoft saying it had disrupted five state-affiliated actors, including some from China. \"These actors generally sought to use OpenAI services for querying open-source information, translating, finding coding errors, and running basic coding tasks,\"the firm said at the time. Anthropic has not said how it concluded the hackers in this latest campaign were linked to the Chinese government. The Chinese embassy in the US told reporters it was not involved. It comes as some cyber security companies have been criticised for over-hyping cases where AI was used by hackers. Critics say the technology is still too unwieldy to be used for automated cyber attacks. In November, cyber experts at Googlereleased a research paperwhich highlighted growing concerns about AI being used by hackers to create brand new forms of malicious software. But the paper concluded the tools were not all that successful - and were only in a testing phase. The cyber security industry, like the AI business, is keen to say hackers are using the tech to target companies in order to boost the interest in their own products. In its blog post, Anthropic argued that the answer to stopping AI attackers is to use AI defenders. \"The very abilities that allow Claude to be used in these attacks also make it crucial for cyber defence,\" the company claimed. And Anthropic admitted its chatbot made mistakes. For example, it made up fake login usernames and passwords and claimed to have extracted secret information which was in fact publicly available. \"This remains an obstacle to fully autonomous cyberattacks,\" Anthropic said.

A new report by Physicians for Human Rights Israel (PHRI) alleges a practice of \"systematic killings and cover-ups\". The report covers the period between 7 October 2023, when Hamas launched its deadly attack on Israel, sparking the latest conflict in Gaza, and 31 August 2025. It said fewer than 30 Palestinians died in Israeli custody in the 10 years prior. The Israel Prison Service (IPS) told the BBC it \"operates in accordance with the law and under the supervision of official oversight bodies\". It said it did not comment on figures or allegations from outside bodies. \"All inmates are held according to legal procedures, and their rights including access to medical care, hygiene, and adequate living conditions are upheld by professionally trained staff,\" the IPS added. Since 7 October 2023, thousands of Palestinians have been detained across Gaza and the West Bank, many without charge. PHRI said it had exposed a deeply concerning pattern of systematic human rights violations committed against Palestinians detained by Israel and classified as \"security prisoners\". It said this was carried out as part of an official policy implemented by Israeli authorities since the war began. Israeli authorities have stopped providing information about Palestinians in custody to the Red Cross and barred access to detention facilities. PHRI said its report is based on official records and data cross-referenced with forensic reports, information from other human rights groups and efforts to locate specific people, as well as testimony from detainees, their families and lawyers. Its authors say 52 of those who died were being held in military prisons while 42 died in civilian jails run by the IPS. PHRI says the deaths were caused by physical violence, medical neglect, or both. It singles out the policies of Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israel's right-wing national security minister and a key member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition government. PHRI said that, under Ben-Gvir's control, Israel's incarceration facilities holding Palestinians had \"effectively been transformed into sites of torture and abuse\". It added daily physical violence was widespread, and that the deprivation of human rights and systematic torture had resulted in the deaths of dozens of Palestinians. The highest number of deaths, 29, occurred at the Sde Teiman military prison in Southern Israel, near Gaza. Five Israeli reservist soldiers have been charged with aggravated abuse and causing serious bodily harm, after a Palestinian prisoner was allegedly beaten and stabbed in the rectum with a sharp object at Sde Teiman in July 2024. Footage emerged showing reserve soldiers taking a detainee aside and surrounding him with riot shields before he was allegedly attacked. The five reservists deny the charges and have not been named. The alleged assault has divided the nation, with some right-wing politicians criticising a military police investigation and even some \"right to rape\" protests outside the jail. The PHRI report accuses the Israeli authorities of trying to \"cover up\" and suppress investigations into Palestinian deaths and alleged abuses in custody. In said that, in many cases, detainees' family members were not notified that their relatives had died and access to post-mortems was denied. The report also said there had been a failure to prosecute Israeli prison staff and soldiers. It examined a policy of what it called \"forced disappearance\", through which thousands of Palestinians have been detained without their families being notified or told where their relatives are being held. PHRI said these \"grave violations of international law\" had made determining the full scope of Israel's prisoner policy and the fate of the many Palestinians taken into custody extremely difficult, if not impossible. The group estimates the actual number of Palestinians killed could be higher than the number it has been able to document. The IPS said \"the claims described do not reflect the conduct or procedures of the Israel Prison Service, and we are not aware of the incidents as presented\". It continued: \"Every death in IPS custody is examined in accordance with established procedures and referred to the competent authorities as required. \"For reasons of privacy, security, and legal limitations, the IPS does not provide personal or statistical details regarding inmates, nor does it comment on individual cases.\" The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it operates \"in accordance with Israeli and international law\", and \"detains individuals in Gaza when there is reasonable suspicion of their involvement in terrorist activities\". It said that, in some cases, criminal proceedings were then initiated, while in others \"preventive detention is enforced to remove individuals from the fighting, in full alignment with the Israeli law and the Geneva Conventions\". \"Detention orders and their duration are subject to judicial review as required by law,\" it added. The IDF said it was aware of incidents of detainees dying in custody, but that these included people detained with existing illness or injury, adding each death was investigated by military police."}

The actor said Dominic McLaughlin, who is taking over the role for HBO's reboot, then sent him \"a very sweet note back\". Radcliffe, who played the famous schoolboy wizard in the decade-long noughties film franchise,told Good Morning Americahe wrote directly to McLaughlin after the child star was cast in the lead role. His predecessor - who was also 11 years old when he began work on the first Harry Potter movie - wished the youngster and his co-stars all the best for the production, saying: \"I just want to hug them.\" McLaughlin will star opposite Arabella Stanton as Hermione Granger and Alastair Stout as Ron Weasley. Radcliffe said: \"I don't want to be a specter in the life of these children but I just wanted to write to him to say, 'I hope you have the best time, and an even better time than I did - I had a great time, but I hope you have an even better time'.\" \"And I do, I just see these pictures of him and the other kids and I just want to hug them.\" He added: \"They just seem so young. I just look at them and say, 'oh it's crazy I was doing that at that age.' But it's also incredibly sweet and I hope they're having a great time.\" An open casting call for the roles was announced last year, and more than 30,000 children auditioned. The chosen ones - McLaughlin, Stanton and Stout - are all relative newcomers. McLaughlin previously appeared in Grow, a Sky comedy with Nick Frost and Golda Rosheuvel, while Stanton starred as Matilda in the musical of the same name in the West End. Stout had no prior acting credits. The young cast of the new series also includes Lox Pratt as Draco Malfoy, Alessia Leoni as Parvati Patil and Leo Earley as Seamus Finnigan, as well as Rory Wilmot who will play Neville Longbottom and Amos Kitson portraying Dudley Dursley. They will be joined by adult stars including John Lithgow as Albus Dumbledore, Janet McTeer as Minerva McGonagall, Paapa Essiedu as Severus Snape, and Nick Frost as Rubeus Hagrid. Filming is under way for series one of the new show, which is set to launch in 2027. But the entire production is expected to take 10 years to complete in total, as the plan is to film a series to cover each of JK Rowling's seven books, which the films were originally based on. With that in mind, Warner Bros Studios in Leavesden near Watford, where it is being made, was this summer granted permission to build a temporary school for the child actors to study in for real, when they're not at Hogwarts."}

North Kesteven District Council rejected the 75-acre (30 hectare) farm at Scredington, near Sleaford, in March, over concerns the archeologically sensitive area had not been properly investigated. However, Mareham Lane Solar Ltd, the company behind the plans, appealed the decision in September and has submitted new archaeological information to the government's Planning Inspectorate (PI). The PI confirmed there would be a public inquiry starting on 3 February. Objections were raised during the initial planning process after prehistoric, Roman and medieval discoveries were made in the area, with concerns there could be more buried below. According to theLocal Democracy Reporting Service, the proposed solar farm would be able to power 15,000 homes. Kirkby La Thorpe and South Kyme ward councillor Mervyn Head said the outcome was \"very disappointing\". \"I still don't think the archaeological situation has been resolved,\" he said. \"It has been a sham by the Planning Inspectorate, disregarding good reason for refusal.\" Meanwhile, Councillor Ian Carrington said the PI decision to accept new evidence \"undermines the trust of the public in the entire planning process\" if rules were not the same for everyone. \"To use their powers in this way is extremely rare,\" he added. However, he accepted the authority no longer had a valid planning reason to reject the application, adding that to fight the proposal would be \"very complex and expensive\". \"To go down that when officers are advising us we don't have a hope of winning would be folly and a waste of public money,\" Carrington added. The PI said it had not received \"any correspondence from the council to indicate that they will not be contesting the appeal\" and that it was not able to comment any further.

Toyah Cordingley was \"repeatedly\" stabbed with a sharp object and put in a shallow sandy grave with \"little or no hope of surviving\", the jury has heard. The 24-year-old's body was discovered by her father the following day on Wangetti Beach - a stretch of coastline between the tourist centres of Cairns and Port Douglas. Rajwinder Singh, 41, denies murdering Ms Cordingley on a Sunday afternoon in October 2018 in Far North Queensland. The jury of 10 men and two women, plus three back-up jurors, attended the beach along with the judge and barristers on Monday morning local time, as the second week of the trial got under way. In a nod to the tropical conditions and temperatures above 30C, Justice Lincoln Crowley wore a T-shirt, sport shorts and trainers rather than a wig and robes. Both the lead prosecution and defence barristers opted for polo shirts, shorts and baseball caps. The jurors were led around 1.2km north up the sand to see where Ms Cordingley's body was discovered. Earlier, as they arrived by bus, four red and white cones marked where the victim's car had been parked. The trip was intended to help the jurors become familiar with key locations in the case and no official evidence was given. Last week, the Cairns Supreme Court heard that the day after Ms Cordingley's body was discovered, Mr Singh flew from Australia to India – leaving behind his wife, three children and parents. He was not heard from until he was arrested four years later, the prosecution said. It is alleged that Mr Singh, who was working as a nurse in the town of Innisfail, south of Cairns, had a confrontation with Ms Cordingley, whom prosecutor Nathan Crane described as \"a young woman, blonde and attractive\". The pharmacy worker was found wearing a bikini, with all her other clothes and most of her possessions missing. Those items were taken by the killer to avoid detection, prosecutors allege. Her dog, Indie, which Ms Cordingley had taken to the beach for a walk, was found tied up to a tree hidden in shrubland about 30 metres from the grave. No murder weapon was ever recovered, and no eyewitnesses have been found. But the prosecution says the crown's case – though circumstantial – was made up of evidence that pointed to Mr Singh \"and eliminated others\". This will include evidence that DNA recovered from a stick at the scene was 3.8 billion times more likely to have come from Mr Singh than a random member of the public. The jury has already heard evidence suggesting that Ms Cordingley's phone left the beach after the killing – and that its movements matched those of a blue Alfa Romeo owned by the accused. Mr Singh's sudden departure from Australia also pointed to his guilt, the prosecution has argued. \"As the police were finding Toyah's body, he was organising... a hurriedly arranged one way trip back to India,\" Mr Crane said last week as he opened his case. The defence is yet to present any evidence, but in his opening address, Mr Singh's barrister Greg McGuire described his client as a \"placid\" and \"caring\" man, who was in the \"wrong place at the wrong time\". He also foreshadowed evidence to come later in the trial that, after his arrest, Mr Singh told an undercover officer he had seen two masked men attack Ms Cordingley and then had run away in fear - something he said was his \"biggest mistake\". Mr McGuire has also said he will give evidence about other people \"both known and unknown\" who should come under suspicion. Ms Cordingley's boyfriend at the time, Marco Heidenreich, whom police quickly ruled out as a possible suspect, was among those who gave evidence last week. The court heard he was an immediate police suspect - and that he had faced questions from Ms Cordingley's father about whether he was involved in his girlfriend's disappearance, even before her body was found. Photographs showing Mr Heidenreich on a hike with a friend on the day Ms Cordingley went missing have been shown to the court, with an expert saying he was confident the pictures were genuine and had not been doctored in any way. The trial will return to the more conventional setting of the courthouse on Tuesday."}

The Dali container ship, which crashed into the bridge and left six workers dead, was \"preventable\", National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigators said during a hearing on Tuesday. Police stationed at the bridge's ends were notified that the ship had veered off course but did not call the construction team's inspector to warn them. Had the six workers been notified when police were, the NTSB said, they may have had time to evacuate. \"There would have been about one minute and 29 seconds to evacuate\" before the collision, said NTSB engineer Scott Parent, according to the Washington Post. That could have been \"sufficient time to drive to a portion of the bridge that did not collapse\", he said. In the black of night on 26 March 2024, several vehicles on the Scott Key bridge plunged into the icy waters of the River Patapsco in Baltimore, Maryland, after the Dali container ship crashed into one of its pillars. Six workers fell to their deaths. Tuesday's hearing unveiled the potential causes behind the deadly tragedy, as outlined in the NTSB's year-long investigation. The agency identified multiple factors, including the loss of electrical power from a faulty cable, problems with a fuel pump on the ship and a lack of counter measures to reduce the bridge's vulnerability. The NTSB also reviewed its safety recommendations. The findings confirmed those of a 2024 NTSB preliminary report, which had cited faulty cables as the likely cause of an electrical blackout on the Dali in the final moments before collision. \"This tragedy should have never occurred. Lives should have never been lost. As with all accidents we investigate, this was preventable,\" NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said at the hearing. The deadly incident was massively disruptive to the major US shipping Port of Baltimore while it was closed, and severed part of a major interstate roadway. Officials preliminarily estimated the repairs would be completed by 2028 and cost roughly $1.9bn (£1.4bn). However, an update on Monday estimated the total cost of repairs to be closer to $5bn and moved the timeline for completion to 2030. \"Just as families across the country are dealing with the reality of increased costs, so is Maryland,\" the state's Democratic Governor Wes Moore said in a statement on Monday. \"Trade policies out of Washington, D.C. have raised prices on everything - including essential materials we need in order to rebuild the Francis Scott Key Bridge. \"Still, despite this new economic reality, our resolve is unwavering,\" he said."}

BYD, which offers cheaper models than many of its Western rivals, said its share of the UK market jumped to 3.6% in September. The company will launch more new hybrid and electric cars in the months ahead, said the BYD's UK manager Bono Ge. He added that the brand's future in Britain looks \"hugely exciting\", having just opened its 100th retail outlet. UK EV sales hit a record high last month, with sales of pure battery electric vehicles rising to almost 73,000, according to the SMMT. Sales of plug-in hybrid cars grew even faster, it said. The Kia Sportage, Ford Puma and Nissan Qashqai were the best-selling cars in September. Chinese models - the Jaecoo 7 and BYD Seal U - were also in the top 10. But despite the surge in overall EV sales in the UK, petrol and diesel vehicles still made up more than half of new car sales last month, according to the SMMT. In October last year, the EU announced it would hit imports of Chinese EVs with levies of up to 45%. The measure is aimed to protect European car makers from being undermined by what the EU believes are unfair Chinese-state subsidies. Chinese car makers like BYD have been effectively shut out of the US by high tariffs, which were backed by both President Donald Trump and his predecessor Joe Biden. Despiteslowing sales in China, BYD remains well ahead of US rival Tesla globally. Its sales have also outpaced European rivals, including Jaguar and BMW. In July this year, the UK government allocated£650m ($875m) of discounts for car buyers in a bid to boost the adoption of EVs. Car buyers can claim subsidies of up to £3,750 on purchases of brands including Nissan, Peugeot and Vauxhall. But the scheme excludes Chinese-made vehicles due to the emissions produced in their manufacture. BYD has criticised the decision and said it would damage the UK's car market in the long-term."}

Lando Norris has a commanding 24-point lead over McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri heading into the Las Vegas Grand Prix, which takes place under the lights on the Strip at 04:00 GMT on Sunday. That is followed by grands prix in Qatar, from 28-30 November, and then Abu Dhabi, from 5-7 December. Before the race in Vegas, BBC F1 correspondent Andrew Benson answers your latest questions. Are Ferrari chair John Elkann's comments that Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc need to concentrate \"on driving and talk less\" after their poor results this season unfair? - Jordan John Elkann certainly caused a stir withhis remarks the day after the Sao Paulo Grand Prix. It's not clear what exactly provoked them, as Ferrari did not say. But given they came less than 24 hours after Hamilton had said that his run of results in his first season at Ferrari were \"a nightmare, and I have been living it for a while\", it would not be unreasonable to suppose the seven-time champion might have been in Elkann's mind. As far as Hamilton goes, this is typical of the sort of emotional remark he makes when he has had a disappointing race. Remember when he said after Hungarian Grand Prix qualifying that he was \"just useless\" and \"drove terribly\" and Ferrari \"probably need to change driver\"? He didn't mean that then, not really. And Brazil should be seen in that context. After all, Hamilton went on to say: \"I believe there is something extraordinary up ahead in my life and in my destiny. I truly still believe in this team and what we can achieve together.\" Which is, one might think, exactly the sort of message Elkann would want to hear. The issue many people had with Elkann's comments was that their accuracy was questionable. He singled out the mechanics for praise for \"basically winning the championship with their performance and everything that has been done on the pit stops\", on the basis they are leading therankings for average pit-stop time.,external Fair enough, but then he said: \"If we look at our engineers, there's no doubt that the car has improved.\" Well, perhaps it has. But not relative to the opposition. Ferrari were 0.372 seconds off the pace on average in qualifying in the first half of the season, and so far in the second they are 0.472secs off. As for the drivers, yes, Hamilton has been through the mill this year, but his performances have improved over the season, even if Brazil was a difficult race for him. But Leclerc has been outstanding. And while he has pointed out regularly that the car is not quick enough, no-one would disagree with that, not even Elkann. Ferrari are in F1 to win. Nothing less is good enough. That's just a fact. And Leclerc has been steadfastly loyal to the team. Ferrari are briefing that Elkann's remarks should be seen as a spur for the team to do better. But it's hard to see how Leclerc and Hamilton would take especially kindly to them, however well meaning they were. Chequered Flag Extra: Hamilton's Ferrari 'nightmare' & Ocon on life at Haas The grid seems to be as close in performance as I have ever seen. Has F1 succeeded in creating a situation where each driver's performance over a weekend is a bigger differentiator than in the past, and does the upcoming regulation change threaten this balance? - Matt It stands to reason that if the cars are closer in performance, then the driver would make more of a difference. Whether that is more a factor now than at any other time is a difficult question to answer because there are a lot of aspects of F1 now that work in some ways to reduce the difference between drivers. Telemetry, for example, allows drivers who are not as naturally able to find the limit a chance to catch up over a weekend. You could see this, for example, at Alpine when Fernando Alonso partnered Esteban Ocon. At the start of a weekend, Alonso would typically be considerably quicker than Ocon, who would inch closer with each session until he was competitive in qualifying and sometimes able to beat him. Something else to factor in is that many would argue that the depth of talent at the top of F1 right now is as good as it has ever been, if not better. In Hamilton, Max Verstappen and Alonso, there are three drivers who would be on anyone's list of all-time greats. In addition, Lando Norris, Oscar Piastri, George Russell and Leclerc are all exceptional, without question. That's at least seven world-class drivers in F1 at the same time. Any major regulation change inevitably increases both the gaps between teams, and the risk that one team will steal a march on the rest of the field, as happened in 2022 with Red Bull and 2014 with Mercedes. It would be no surprise if this happened again in 2026. At the same time, there are a lot of very high calibre teams in F1 now, so it should not take too long for the grid to close up again. Just 0.528 seconds separated the top 10 on the grid for the Sao Paulo Grand Prix As the season nears the end, the rookies are increasingly showing their talent. Is there an argument to allow more testing in current cars for new drivers than the current regulations offer? Oliver Bearman, Kimi Antonelli and Isack Hadjar really look settled and in a good place. - Chris Well, you could argue that there is no need to change the testing regulations as Antonelli, Bearman and Hadjar have all proved their talent without the need for it! There is no appetite in F1 to increase testing allowances. Testing is expensive. Having said that, there is an acceptance that rookie drivers could do with more opportunities to experience F1. That's why the rules were changed this year to force teams to run rookies in two sessions per car - a total of four for the season. And it's why teams have started running young drivers in cars from previous years - so called testing of previous cars (TPC) and testing of historic cars (THC). Antonelli, for example, did an extensive TPC programme last year, and this is becoming increasingly common as a way of preparing rookies for F1 debuts. Race at 04:00 GMT on 23 November Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live; live text updates on BBC Sport website and app Are Aston Martin the team to watch next season with Adrian Newey in charge of the design of next year's car? - Ian The truth is no-one knows what the competitive order will be next year, and no-one will know until the first race of the season. Newey has a strong record when it comes to regulation changes. He aced the ones in 1998 with McLaren, 2009 with Red Bull (once the controversial advantage of Brawn's double diffuser had been neutralised), and in 2022 with Red Bull again. In 1998, he had officially joined McLaren only in September of the previous year. With Aston Martin, he has had six more months than that, albeit F1 is a lot more complex now. Of course, the whole of F1 is waiting with interest to seehow Newey gets on with Aston Martin. On the engine side, Honda, which will become sole factory partner to Aston Martin, clearly knows what it's doing. Aston Martin's lead driver is pretty handy, as well. But success in F1 tends to come from stability. And stable is the last thing Aston Martin have been in recent years. There have been a dizzying number staff changes at senior levels,and they are continuing to this day. A new leadership structure has to bed down. Andy Cowell has only been chief executive officer for a little over a year, and Newey did not join until March this year. Enrico Cardile was signed from Ferrari in July 2024, but took on his role as chief technical officer only in August. In many ways, in those circumstances, it would be a miracle if Aston Martin were competitive next year. But, well, Newey… Send us your question for F1 correspondent Andrew Benson"}

The gaps in implementation became glaring as the BBC shadowed Bihar officials in a misty October morning raid on bootleggers. Armed excise officers, with a sniffer dog, sped across the Ganges on a boat to raid an illegal distillery. On reaching the outskirts of the capital, Patna, the team found a ramshackle setup of a dozen metal drums - part of a makeshift apparatus fermenting jaggery, a type of cane sugar, into country liquor. Vapour rose from the drums embedded in the riverside mud, the surfaces still warm. The officers said the site was active minutes earlier, but the alcohol-makers had fled by the time they arrived. \"They often get tipped off before a raid,\" an officer who didn't wish to be named said. Despite these enforcement gaps, alcohol prohibition remains firmly in place in Bihar. Passed in 2016 by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar after persistent demands from women's groups, the law was among the factors that helped his Janata Dal (United) - Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alliance clinch a decisive state election victory earlier this month. State officials tout the policy's success by pointing to big numbers: since the law took effect, 1.1 million cases have been registered and 650,000 people convicted for violations. But the devil lies in the detail. More than 99% of these convictions are for consumption, rather than production, selling, or transport of illicit liquor. Moreover, alcohol remains widely available in the black market in Bihar. In the six weeks leading to the recently held election, illicit alcohol worth more than 522 million rupees ($6.26 million, £4.96 million) was seized from across the state. So why has Bihar been unable to enforce its ban more effectively? Local police, who did not want to come on record, say it is a combination of several factors - including staff shortages, increasingly sophisticated smuggling methods and possible collusion between liquor makers and authorities. \"There are laws that prescribe life imprisonment or even the death penalty for murder. But does that stop people from committing murder? No, it doesn't,\" said Ratnesh Sada, an outgoing minister whose department handled prohibition issues. Mr Sada, however, insisted that action has been taken against at least a hundred individuals engaged in illegal alcohol trade, with their properties seized. \"We destroy these setups, but within days they are up and running again,\" said Sunil Kumar, an excise official. Bihar's geography makes enforcement even harder. The landlocked state borders Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and West Bengal -  all of which allow alcohol and serve as major sources of smuggled liquor. It also shares a 726km (449 mile), largely porous border with Nepal, which officials say has become a key conduit for alcohol smuggling, further complicating enforcement. Despite the challenges, many women in Bihar -  who still carry deep scars from their husbands' alcohol abuse -  want the ban to continue. In Chhapra district, Lalmunni Devi, who lost her husband after he consumed toxic liquor in 2022, said her life had been upended by alcohol abuse. \"I just hope no one else has to suffer the same fate,\" she said. Neetu Devi, another widow, broke down as she recalled her husband's death. \"If the government were to shut down all such factories entirely, it [liquor] would no longer be available. It continues to be produced, and that's why people keep consuming it,\" she said. Rajeev Kamal Kumar, an anthropologist at Patna's AN Sinha Institute of Social Sciences, who worked on a government study of prohibition, says both sides of the story are true. \"Many women and elders say prohibition has improved household finances, children's education, and nutrition. But it is undeniable that illegal trade continues,\" he said. Bihar is neither the first nor the only Indian state to impose prohibition; several others have tried it over the years. But such measures often trigger unintended consequences - from thriving black markets and deaths from illicit brews, to enforcement challenges that drain state resources. The financial cost has also been considerable, as alcohol taxes remain a key source of revenue for many state governments. Gujarat and Nagaland have had bans since 1960 and 1989, yet both still grapple with bootlegging. Mizoram imposed prohibition in 1997, lifted it in 2015, reinstated it in 2019, and then relaxed it again in 2022 to allow the manufacture, sale and export of wine made from local grapes. Some other states have rolled back prohibition after encountering economic and administrative challenges. For now, with the outgoing government slated to return to power, prohibition will remain in Bihar. But the policy remains a paradox - hailed as a social reform by some, criticised as ineffective by others. Whether it has succeeded or merely shifted the problem underground is a question that continues to haunt the state. Follow BBC News India onInstagram,YouTube,TwitterandFacebook."}

Cupuaçu... Taperebá... Bacaba... Like açaí berries - these fruits are rich in antioxidants, fibre or fatty acids. If Brazil has its way, they could soon be popping up on your social media feeds and being sold in fashionable cafes in the UK, Europe and the US. It's part of a bold plan by the country, which is hosting the COP30 UN climate talks, to tackle climate change, protect nature and create wealth in the face of considerable regional poverty. \"There's a lot of superfoods in the forest that people don't know,\" says Max Petrucci, founder of a local company Mahta that sells powdered cacao and Brazil nuts for shakes. The drink he gives me to try is gritty and tastes like chocolate without sugar. \"We're focussed first on nutrition and the health benefits that these Amazonian ingredients provide,\" he explains. But the second benefit, he explains, is \"social and environmental\". He says they pay fair prices and only buy from farmers who practice sustainable farming. It sounds like a marketing pitch and the company's slick packaging promises \"ancestral ingredients\" and the \"power of purple fruits from the forest\". Scientific research into the benefits of \"superfoods\" is limited, buteating Amazonian fruits is generally recognised to be good for you. Larissa Bueno, also at Mahta, explains that they only sell powdered foods - \"similar to Huel in the UK,\" she says. Transporting raw fruits that degrade within days of picking is expensive. But if companies freeze dry ingredients into powders to sell to supermarkets or ship abroad, \"it keeps more of the nutritional value and it's a smart way to keep more economic value in Brazil\", she explains. The lab in Belém's Bioeconomy Park is helping small companies test new ways of preserving fruits. \"People have been eating from these forests for more than 10,000 years. There are many, many, many undiscovered superfoods, \" Max says. The Amazon rainforest, which covers 6 million sq km (2.3 million sq miles), has always been full of natural wealth. But for decades its vast ecosystem has been decaying, with areas chopped down to sell timber or clear space for cattle or crops like soy. This damaged one of the earth's great protections against climate change - trees that soak up planet-warming carbon dioxide. Unusually,more than two-thirds of Brazil's greenhouse gas emissions come from land use and agriculture, rather than energy like most countries. Those emissions mainly stem from cutting down forest or growing vast amounts of food. President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has promised to halve deforestation by 2030. In the 12 months to July 2025, rates reached an 11-year low. But the forest is a resource. The nearly 30 million people living in the Amazon region, and across Brazil, need and want to make a living. Brazil is pushing the idea of building a prospering economy by sustainably using natural resources, preserving nature to protect the vitality of the land, and developing valuable products including fuels, pharmaceuticals, and foods. Building this \"bio-economy\" features strongly in its national climate action plan. Sarah Sampaio runs a small coffee company that grows coffee beans in the shadow of trees, using a method called agroforesty - or agriculture that helps cultivate forests. She works with around 200 farming families in the Apui region, which has one of the highest rates of deforestation. \"We plant native Amazonian trees and the coffee together. The trees shade the coffee plants and farmers can also grow their own food around those plants,\" she says. \"When the coffee plant dies, the trees remain as the forest, so it's helping to restore the Amazon.\" The fresh brew I'm given has a light, fruity taste, and she's proud that three of her coffees were selected among the 30 best in Brazil in the national Coffee of the Year competition. \"If we want to stop more trees from being chopped down, we have to provide people with an alternative income, a sustainable way of living,\" Sarah says. Whatever the next Amazonian superfood is, it will need to challenge açaí. The purple berry is grown and eaten in huge quantities in northern Brazil and sold for nearly £10 ($13) per smoothie bowl in parts of London. Damien Benoit sells açaí ice cream in Europe. \"It's very high in antioxidants, in fibres and unsaturated fatty acids, and in different minerals that make it very popular among people who do sports,\" he says. He works with families who keeps four hectares of açai plants in the forest \"with a minimum number of species per hectare that must be monitored.\" \"We make sure children go to school, and gender equality is a huge topic for us,\" he claims. On their own, these small companies cannot feed millions of people and, so far, they've prospered due to grants or capital from charities and funds that invest in companies aimed at protecting nature. And there are questions around how much they can be scaled up. If açaí production was expanded into many industrial-size plantations, it could start to cause exactly the same problems that people like Damien are trying to solve. But there's a reason the word \"bioeconomy\" is plastered all over the UN climate talks. \"We need to move from a world dependent on fossil fuels - that is clear,\" says Ana Yang, Director of the Environment and Society Centre at Chatham House. \"And if we don't have solutions that are bio-based, we will not be able to do that,\" she says. This is by no means a magic bullet solution to the problem of how to replace fossil fuels with clean energy and use the land in a way that protects nature. Brazil has also promised a four-fold increase in the use of biofuels, which can be controversial, by 2035. Biofuels such as ethanol are often touted as a replacement for fossil fuels, but they can lead to deforestation as demand increases for the crop to burn to make the fuel. Some are concerned this will lead to the unsustainable extraction of timber or sugarcane to export abroad and burn, and the theft of indigenous peoples' land. Ms Yang says it's essential to put safeguards like strong regulation in place. \"Not all bio-based transitions are good,\" she says. \"If they lead to destruction of natural habitat or they don't have good social practices, then it isn't solving the original problem.\""}

I have,\" says Stephen McCann, general & technical manager at Halt, a wood treatment company in Belfast. \"I wouldn't recommend it,\" he adds, however. It's very salty, apparently. But this liquid, containing a substance called Burnblock, has been shown to prevent fire taking hold of wood in tests. In a videothe firm has shared online, two small model houses are blasted with a blow torch. One, treated with a different product, is engulfed in flames to such an extent that it collapses. The Burnblock-treated model gets heavily charred in one corner but remains otherwise unharmed. What is Burnblock exactly? No-one will say. Neither Mr McCann nor Hroar Bay-Smidt, chief executive of Burnblock itself, a Danish firm, will confirm the ingredients. However, documentation on Burnblock's website from the Danish Technological Institute states the flame retardant ingredient is \"a natural component in the body\" and that the mixture also contains citric acid and \"a natural component in some berries\". Flame retardants, chemicals added to products to try and slow down how they burn, have been around in various forms for centuries. But many of the flame retardants developed in the 20th Centuryare highly toxic. \"There hasn't been a lot of investment in replacements so now all of a sudden people are scrambling to find them,\" says Alex Morgan, a chemist and flame retardant expert at the University of Dayton Research Institute in the US. When you try to set fire to wood treated with Burnblock, the material forms a protective layer of char, explains Mr Bay-Smidt. \"It also releases some water,\" he adds. \"That helps absorb the heat and slows the fire's spread.\" And, it prevents oxygen feeding the flames. You can add Burnblock to other building materials, he says, including dried seagrass. Halt, which has been operating in Belfast for nearly four years, has supplied Burnblock-treated wood products to hundreds of locations around the UK and Ireland. From restaurants to hotels and even HS2. For the latter, Halt provided treated hoardings used to fence off construction areas in tunnels. \"It could be quite difficult to get out of the tunnel so they need as much time as possible to evacuate [in the event of a fire],\" says Mr McCann. I ask whether any of the buildings or facilities constructed with wood treated by Halt have ever been affected by a fire to date – \"No\" is the answer. In one of Halt's buildings they have a huge machine called an autoclave, consisting mainly of two large horizontal tubes. The top one is a tank containing the treatment fluid that I saw earlier. When the tube below it is loaded with pieces of wood, it first exposes them to a vacuum, to open up the wood's pores, says Mr McCann. Then, pressure appropriate to the species of wood in question is applied, along with the treatment fluid. \"What that pressure is doing is, it's forcing the fire retardant into the very core of the timber,\" says Mr McCann. After this, the wood goes into a large kiln where it is dried in a process that can last anywhere from 10 days to six weeks. It's carefully managed – drying that happens too quickly or too slowly can warp the wood. \"Timber is an amazing material,\" says Richard Hull, professor emeritus and fire retardants expert at the University of Lancashire. He refers to wood's ability to take up treatment fluids within its pores. \"You can ultimately change the chemistry of its burning behaviour,\" he says. Hull is often sceptical of new flame retardants, however. He points out that some ideas have come and gone. \"There was a lot of work done on clay nanocomposites in the early 2000s,\" he says. \"Now, 20-25 years later, essentially 99% of that has fizzled out.\" While timber tends to burn at a fixed rate, making plastic flame resistant is another story because plastics tend to burn at an accelerating rate, he explains. Dr Morgan adds that he calls polyethylene, a type of plastic commonly used in construction, \"solid gasoline\" because of its similar chemical structure and capacity to burn rapidly. In Australia, First Graphene says it has found a way to slow the spread of fire in plastics by adding graphene – tiny flakes of carbon atoms arranged in honeycomb lattices. Michael Bell, managing director and chief executive, says the firm's solution, PureGRAPH, has already been added to products including protective footwear and conveyor belts used in the mining industry. First Graphene says it works by forming a protective gas barrier, preventing the release of volatile compounds prior to ignition, and also a char layer should ignition occur. But graphene is a notoriously enigmatic material and the company says there may be other mechanisms at work, which are not yet fully understood. Could graphene affect people's health following a fire? A spokeswoman says, \"There's no data suggesting that graphene poses any health hazards. The industry continues to test and evaluate these aspects.\" In the UK, Vector Homes is preparing to sell a licence for PureGRAPH to makers of plastic pellets that could be used to make construction materials such as fascia boards. Experiments suggest that the graphene does reduce the plastic's ability to burn. \"It hits the highest ratings in those tests,\" says Liam Britnell, co-founder and chief technology officer. Buildings aren't just at risk from fires that start inside them, though. \"There's an increase in wildfires,\" says Dr Morgan. That's why Eric Appel at Stanford University, and colleagues have been working on gel-like fire retardants that could be sprayed onto a home hours before a wildfire reaches it, to limit the damage. Prof Appel hopes to test the substance on mini structures, or mock-built homes, soon. Lab work revealed that, upon exposure to a flame, one of the gels he was working on bubbled up to form a porous aerogel structure within it that is highly protective against fire. \"As soon as I saw that it did that, it was like, 'Oh my gosh – that would be perfect for this',\" recalls Prof Appel."}

But in recent years firms have been moving that work into much more remote areas, where costs for staff and space are lower. The trend is know as cloud farming, and AI has given it another boost with numerous smaller towns hosting firms working on AI. Mohan Kumar is one worker who has benefited from that. He lives in the small town of TN Palayam, in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. \"My role is in AI annotation. I collect data from various sources, label it, and train AI models so they can recognize and predict objects. Over time, the models become semi-supervised and can make decisions on their own,\" he says. So does Mr Kumar think he is missing out, by not being in a big city? \"Professionally, there is no real difference. Whether in small towns or metros, we work with the same global clients from the US and Europe, and the training and skills required are the same,\" says Mr Kumar. Mr Kumar works for Desicrew, which is headquartered in Chennai. Founded in 2005 it was a pioneer in cloud farming. \"We realised that instead of forcing people to migrate to cities in search of jobs, we could bring jobs to where people already live,\" says Mannivannan J K, the chief executive of Desicrew . \"For too long, opportunities have been concentrated in cities, leaving rural youth behind. Our mission has always been to create world-class careers closer to home, while proving that quality work can be delivered from anywhere.\" Desicrew does all sorts of outsourced work including software testing for start-up firms, building datasets to train AI, and moderating content. At the moment 30 to 40% of its work is AI related, \"but very soon, it will grow to 75 to 100%,\" says Mr J K. Much of that work is transcription - turning audio to text. \"Machines understand text far better,\" he explains. \"For AI to work naturally, machines must be trained to understand variations in how people speak. That's why transcription is such a crucial step, it forms the foundation for machines to comprehend and respond across languages, dialects, and contexts.\" Doing such work in a smaller town is not a disadvantage, Mr J K says. \"People often assume rural means underdeveloped, but our centres mirror urban IT hubs in every way – secure data access, reliable connectivity, and uninterrupted power. The only difference is geography. \" Around 70% of his workforce are women: \"For many, this is their first salaried job, and the impact on their families is transformative – from financial security to education for their children,\" says Mr J K. Founded in 2008, NextWealth was also an early mover in cloud farming. Headquartered in Bangalore, it employs 5,000 staff in 11 offices in smaller towns across India. \"Sixty percent of India's graduates come from small towns, but most IT companies hire only from the metros. That leaves behind a huge untapped pool of smart, first-generation graduates,\" says Mythily Ramesh, co-founder and managing director of NextWealth. \"Many of these students are first-generation graduates. Their parents are farmers, weavers, tailors, policemen - families who take loans to fund their education,\" she says. NextWealth started with outsourced work from the back offices of big companies, but five years ago moved into artificial intelligence. \"The world's most advanced algorithms are being trained and validated in India's small towns,\" says Ms Ramesh. Around 70% of its work comes from the US. \"Every AI model, from a ChatGPT-like system to facial recognition, needs vast amounts of human-labelled data. That is the backbone of cloud-farming jobs.\" She thinks there is plenty more work to come. \"In the next 3–5 years, AI and GenAI will create close to 100 million jobs in training, validation, and real-time handling. India's small towns can be the backbone of this workforce.\" She is hopeful that India can remain a hub for such work. \"Countries like the Philippines may catch up, but India's scale and early start in AI sourcing gives us a five to seven-year advantage. We must leverage it before the gap narrows,\" she says. KS Viswanathan is a technology advisor, and formerly worked at India's National Association of Software and Service Companies, the trade association for outsourcing firms. \"Silicon Valley may be building the AI engines, but the day-to-day work that keeps those engines reliable increasingly comes from India's cloud farming industry,\" he says. \"We are truly at a tipping point. If cloud farming continues to scale, small-town India could well become the world's largest hub for AI operations, just as it became the hub for IT services two decades ago.\" While NextWealth and Desicrew both say they have access to reliable and secure internet connections, Mr Viswanathan says that is not always the case in India's smaller towns. \"Reliable high-speed internet and secure data centres are not always at par with metros, which makes data protection a constant concern.\" Even if good connections are in place, work needs to be done to reassure clients. \"The bigger challenge is the perception rather than a technical one. International clients often assume small towns cannot meet data security standards, even when the systems are robust. Trust has to be earned through delivery.\" Back at NextWealth, Dhanalakshmi Vijay \"fine-tunes\" AI. For example, if it confuses two similar looking items, like a blue denim jacket and a navy shirt, she will correct the model. \"These corrections are then fed back into the system, fine-tuning the model so that the next time it sees a similar case, it performs better. Over time, the AI model builds up experience, just like updating software with regular patches to make it more accurate and reliable,\" says Ms Vijay. Such work has an effect in the real world. \"It's me and team who indirectly train the AI models to make your online shopping experience easy and hassle free,\" she says."}

The car had been taking part in a race in the town of Walcha on Saturday night when it drove through a fence and hit the grandstand, New South Wales police said in a statement. The race, part of the annual Walcha Motorcycle Rally, had been a demolition derby - a type of motorsport where drivers ram their vehicles into one another. Brendan Moylan, a member of parliament for Northern Tablelands, the region where Walcha is located, said on social media on Sunday that nine people remained in hospital and \"all are now recovering\". Earlier, police put the number of injured at nine. They said the ages of the injured bystanders ranged from 20 to 75, while a critically injured person was a 54-year-old man. An investigation was under way, they said. Police said they were told that the 27-year-old driver of the car had been involved in a collision on the track right before it drove into the fence. In a statement published on the Walcha Motorcycle Rally's Facebook page, the Walcha Council said that it was \"shocked and stunned at the unfortunate accident\". The Council said it would work with authorities to \"examine the circumstances which led to the accident\". Giving any comments before concluding the inquiries would be \"inappropriate\", it said. In a post on Facebook,Moylan thanked emergency responders and other bystanders for their \"swift and incredibly professional work at the scene\". \"My thoughts are with everyone affected,\" he wrote. Barnaby Joyce, former deputy prime minister and incumbent New England lawmaker, wrote on Facebook that his \"thoughts, prayer and hopes\" were with those injured in the crash. \"Such a sad end to such a great event,\" he wrote. The Walcha Motorcycle Rally describes itself as a \"grassroots event for motorcycle enthusiasts\"."}

The 35 year-old man, named only as Fadel Z, in line with German privacy laws, is charged with having played a key role in procuring products for Hezbollah's drone programme. The German Federal Prosecutor's Office said Fadel Z joined Hezbollah more than 10 years ago, first working in public relations. In a statement, prosecutors said Fadel Z became a \"foreign operator\" for the group's drone programme in 2022, first from Barcelona in Spain. In the summer of 2023, he started working from Germany. According to the statement by prosecutors, Hezbollah has been running \"an extensive drone programme for some time\". Following Hamas's 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel, prosecutors said Hezbollah had \"systematically fired rockets and explosive-laden drones at both military and civilian targets in Israel\". \"By June 2024, it had built up an arsenal of over 10,000 [drone] units.\" To procure such drones \"the organisation employs foreign operatives who covertly purchase components in Europe and export them to Lebanon\", prosecutors said. Fadel Z is accused of purchasing materials and products for drone construction worth around €1.4m (£1.2m), until he was arrested in July 2024. The products came from companies in Europe, China and the US. According to prosecutors, these included more than 2,000 petrol and electric motors, and over 600 propellers. Fadel Z is said to have often used front companies registered in his own name or that of his contacts to place orders. Suppliers were also paid via these companies. Prosecutors say he also arranged for the goods to be transported to Lebanon - where the group is based - either by container ship from ports in Hamburg or Spain or by air freight. Two of the engines purchased by Fadel Z were used in explosive drones that Hezbollah fired at Israel, they added. One of the drones was flown into a retirement home in the town of Herzliya, near Tel Aviv, on the night of 11 October 2024, the Jewish Holy Day of Yom Kippur. Although the explosive device detonated inside the building, none of the 200 or so residents was injured. The Federal Prosecutor's Office said it considered this to be aiding and abetting attempted murder. The trial at the regional court in Celle is expected to last until August next year. Fighting between Israel and Hezbollah escalated after Hezbollah fired rockets at Israeli positions the day after Hamas's attacks on Israel in October 2023, saying it was acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. Israel and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah fought an escalating conflict for 13 months. It culminated in an intense Israeli bombing campaign and ground incursion into southern Lebanon in October. Lebanese authorities said Israel's attacks killed about 4,000 people there - including many civilians - and led to the displacement of more than 1.2 million residents. Israeli authorities said more than 80 of its soldiers and 47 of its civilians were killed in the hostilities."}

They say the way we eat is changing - with a move away from fresh, whole foods to cheap, highly-processed meals - which is increasing our risk of a range of chronic diseases, including obesity and depression. Writing in The Lancet, the researchers say governments need \"to step up\" and introduce warnings and higher taxes on UPF products, to help fund access to more nutritious foods. However some scientists say this review can not prove that UPFs directly cause health harms and more research and trials are needed to show that. Ultra-processed foods are defined as containing more than five ingredients you would not find at home in your kitchen cupboard, such as emulsifiers, preservatives, additives, dyes and sweeteners. Examples of UPFs include sausages, crisps, pastries, biscuits, instant soups, fizzy drinks, ice cream and supermarket bread. Surveys indicate these industrially-manufactured foods are on the rise in diets around the world, worsening the quality of what we eat with too much sugar and unhealthy fats and a lack of fibre and protein. This review of evidence on the impact of UPFs on health, carried out by 43 global experts and based on 104 long-term studies, suggests these foods are linked to a greater risk of 12 health conditions. These include type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, depression and dying prematurely from any cause. Review author Prof Carlos Monteiro, from the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil, who set up the Nova classification system for categorising food, said the growing consumption of ultra-processed foods \"is reshaping diets worldwide, displacing fresh and minimally processed foods and meals\". \"This change in what people eat is fuelled by powerful global corporations who generate huge profits by prioritising ultra-processed products, supported by extensive marketing and political lobbying to stop effective public health policies to support healthy eating,\" he added. Co-author Dr Phillip Baker, from the University of Sydney, said the answer was \"a strong global public health response - like the coordinated efforts to challenge the tobacco industry\". The review acknowledges a lack of clinical trials showing exactly how UPFs damage health - but says that should not delay action to protect people worldwide from potential health harms. Some scientists have commented that it is difficult to untangle the effects of UPFs in people's diets from other factors in people's lives, such as lifestyle, behaviour and wealth. Critics of the Nova classification system say it relies too much on the level of processing in foods, and not on how nutritious that particular food is. For example, wholegrain bread, breakfast cereals, low-fat yoghurts, baby formula milk and fish fingers all count as ultra-processed but have lots of good in them. Prof Kevin McConway, emeritus professor of applied statistics at the Open University, said: \"A study like this can find a correlation, but it can't be certain about cause and effect.\" He said there was still \"room for doubt and for clarification from further research\". \"It seems to me likely that at least some UPFs could cause increases in the risk of some chronic diseases. But this certainly doesn't establish that all UPFs increase disease risk.\" It is still not clear what it is about ultra-processed foods that could be causing or contributing to diseases. Prof Jules Griffin, from the University of Aberdeen, said there were some positive sides to food processing, and more research to understand how it influences our health was \"urgently needed\". The Food and Drink Federation (FDF), which represents the industry, says UPFs can form part of a balanced diet, like frozen peas and wholemeal bread. \"Companies have been making a series of changes over many years to make the food and drink we all buy healthier, in line with government guidelines,\" says Kate Halliwell, chief scientific officer at the FDF. The amount of sugar and salt in products on sale in shops and supermarkets has gone down by a third since 2015, she added. The UK's Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutritionsaid earlier this year that the association between higher consumpton of ultra-processed foods and adverse health outcomes was \"concerning\". But it added it was \"unclear\" whether these foods are unhealthy due to processing or because many of them are high in calories, saturated fat, salt and free sugars. Current UK government advice on diet is to eat more fruit, vegetables and fibre, and cut back on sugar, fat and salt."}

While there are currently no plans to ban the use of the pads, the Football Association says the use of 'mini' shin pads has the potential to \"increase the risk of injury\". Ilfracombe Town's fixture at Bridport on Saturday was abandoned after Martin broke his fibula and tibia during a 50-50 challenge with the home goalkeeper. \"The initial sound of it was unbearable. It was like a shotgun going off,\" Ilfracombe Town chairman Nick Jupp told BBC Radio 5 Live. \"There is no blame on Riley at all for wearing micro shin pads but I think if he had more coverage on the shin area with bigger shin pads, the injury could have been less than it was.\" While shin guards are mandatory under the laws of the game, the rules around them are vague. They currently state that pads must be covered entirely by socks, made of a suitable material (rubber, plastic or similar) and provide a reasonable degree of protection. FurtherFA guidance,externalsays: \"The amount of shin physically covered is an important consideration, as any part of the shin that is not covered is not as well protected. \"'Micro' or 'mini' shin pads may therefore increase the risk of injury due to the smaller amount of shin covered compared to larger sized shin pads. \"We advise that when considering the protection offered by shin pads, safety is prioritised by ensuring a good proportion of the shin area is covered and therefore protected.\" The International Football Association Board (Ifab), football's lawmaker, has been contacted for comment. Ifab has previously said it has no plansto change the rules and stressed that players- or the parents or guardians of youth players - must take responsibility for their own safety on the pitch. \"Players' legs are all different sizes and there are so many different materials,\" a spokesperson said. \"Ifab's view is that this is the responsibility of the individual player and not the referee. Where young players are concerned, that responsibility [should be taken by the coach, parents or guardians].\" Why are some football shin pads so small? Professional football players have been seen wearing small shin pads In a statement, Ilfracombe Town said they have now prohibited \"the use of micro shin pads across all age groups and squads, from youth teams through to senior teams\". They added: \"This decision has been made in the interest of player safety and welfare, and to ensure that all players are equipped with protective gear that meets required safety standards.\" They are not the first club to follow this course of action. Penistone Church in Barnsleyand a number of others cross the lower reaches of the game have taken similar decisions and support their stance. Club chairman Jupp added:  \"I think clubs need to look closely at player welfare and safety regarding these micro shin pads.

The Israeli military said it had targeted members of the Palestinian armed group Hamas \"operating in a training compound... in the Ein el-Hilweh area\". It said the location was used by Hamas to plan and carry out attacks against Israel, which Hamas rejected as \"fabrication and lies\". Israel has carried out regular air strikes on people and places in Lebanon since a deal to end the conflict with the Iran-backed armed group Hezbollah. Most strikes have targeted Hezbollah but Israel has also attacked Hamas in the country. As well as those killed, Lebanon's health ministry said at least four people had been injured in the strike. Images showed emergency workers at the entrance of Ein el-Hilweh, the largest Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon. Footage online also showed ambulances rushing through the narrow streets of the crowded camp as a huge plume of smoke billowed from the location hit. Initial reports said the strike hit an area outside a mosque that is usually busy at night. Condemning the attack, Hamas said it had \"no military installations in the Palestinian camps in Lebanon\" and that the site targeted was an \"open sports field\". In its statement, the IDF said \"prior to the strike, measures were taken to reduce the chance of harm to civilians, including the use of precision munitions, aerial observations, and additional intelligence information\". Hamas attacked southern Israel from Gaza on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others as hostages. Israel's military response has killed at least 69,169 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

In a highly criticalassessment, the defence committee said the UK is \"nowhere near\" where it needs to be to defend itself and allies, especially at a time when security threats to Europe are \"significant\". The report found that the UK is failing to meet its Nato obligations, and falling \"far short of its claimed leadership position\". The report was published as the Ministry of Defence (MoD) identified prospective locations for six new munitions factories, part of a strategy to ramp up domestic defence production. In June, Defence Secretary John Healey announced plans to move the UK to \"war-fighting readiness,\" including £1.5bn to support the construction of new munitions factories, which will be built by private contractors. But after an 11-month inquiry, the defence committee warned the UK and its European Nato allies remained too reliant on the US and is not spending enough on its own defences. Committee chair Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi said: \"Putin's brutal invasion of Ukraine, unrelenting disinformation campaigns, and repeated incursions into European airspace mean that we cannot afford to bury our heads in the sand.\" He said the committee had \"repeatedly heard concerns about the UK's ability to defend itself from attack\". The specific recommendations of the committee's report included a call for the government to accelerate the speed of industrial change, and make \"readiness\" a key objective. Europe's heavy reliance on the US in critical areas such as \"intel, satellites, transportation of troops and air-to-air refuelling\" was also subject to critique in the report. It noted that the UK had \"next to nothing\" when it came to integrated air and missile defences, and pointed torecent drones encroaching on airspace across Europeas a way new technologies can threaten civilian populations in addition to military targets. The report was also particularly critical of what it calls the \"glacial pace\" of promised improvements to civil defence and resilience, saying the UK may be failing to meet itsNato Article 3 obligationsto \"maintain and develop individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack\". Dhesi says the government also needed to deliver on its promise to better communicate with the public about \"the level of threat we face and what to expect in the event of conflict\". \"Wars aren't won just by generals, but by the whole of the population getting behind the Armed Forces and playing our part,\" he added. The government announced earlier this year that UK defence spending would rise to 3% of GDP by 2034 at the latest. In a speech on Wednesday, Healey is expected to announce plans to restart the production of energetics - explosives, pyrotechnics and propellants - in the UK, after two decades of sourcing these materials from overseas. The MoD is scoping out 13 sites where it believes the new factories could be built and has named the areas of the UK where they are located. There are three potential sites in Scotland - in Dumfriesshire, Ayrshire and at Grangemouth, in Stirlingshire. In England, a total of eight sites have been earmarked - in Teesside, Cumbria, Shropshire, Cheshire, Derbyshire, Essex, Worcestershire and Hampshire - and there are two in Wales - in Monmouthshire and Milford Haven, in Pembrokeshire. The government wants at least six new factories to be operational by the next election in 2029, and hopes work will begin on the first of these next year. Healey is also expected to announce the opening of two new drone factories this week in Plymouth and Swindon. \"We are making defence an engine for growth, unambiguously backing British jobs and British skills as we make the UK better ready to fight and better able to deter future conflicts,\" the defence secretary will say. \"This is the path that delivers national and economic security.\""}

The fashion and interiors designer said his trophy, an amber resin piece, was inspired by his own Manchester roots and the \"golden honey of a worker bee\", the insect which has been used by the city to symbolise its industry and togetherness. Showcasing the design for the first time on BBC Radio Manchester, Williamson said he \"wanted something that would really resonate with the city and the people of Manchester\". Brit Awards chairwoman Stacey Tang said the organisation \"couldn't be more pleased with what Matthew has created\". The 49th annual awards ceremony will be hosted at Manchester's Co-op Live venue on 28 February. It will be the first time the event has been held outside of London. Williamson, whose long career in fashion and interior design has seen him work with famous names such as actresses Sienna Miller and Andrea Riseborough and brands like Pucci and Swarovski,  is known for his use of bold colour and pattern. However, he said he had wanted to forego that more predictable route for the trophy design and instead focus on the city. \"I wanted to pause, take stock and offer something truly personal to me,\" he said. \"Above all, I wanted to ensure it connected to Manchester, the Brits' new location and my hometown.\" He said the design had come to him in the most unlikely of places. \"I was in my kitchen, sort of dropping honey from a jar and taking pictures of it as it fell and it created this puddle of a deeper sort of amber tone,\" he said. \"I was like, 'that's what I want this trophy to look like'.\" The Brits trophy is updated for each ceremony and has previously been designed by Dame Vivienne Westwood, Sir Peter Blake and Dame Tracey Emin. Williamson told BBC Radio Manchester he wanted to create something \"chic, elegant and timeless\" that each recipient would feel proud to own and display. \"The winners are going to have pretty sassy homes,\" he said. \"I don't want it to be a doorstop or in the bottom drawer, I want it to be on the mantelpiece.\" He said his final design reflected \"the golden honey of a worker bee, symbolising the city's role during the Industrial Revolution and so much more\". \"This spirit to work hard and be part of the essential fabric of the nation still resonates with me today. \"The Brits also represents the global reach of British music and so I designed the statue to sit on top of a globe. \"I imagine each deserving winner will feel on top of the world as they receive their award and I cannot wait to see the trophy I designed being part of the celebrations on the night.\" The worker bee has been a symbol for Manchester since the mid-1800s and is seen as emblematic of both the city's spirit of industry and its residents' willingness to help one another. Williamson said it was an honour and a career highlight to have been chosen to design the trophy. \"The Brits is an event I've watched since childhood and I'm still so immersed in it to this day,\" he said. \"I've always looked at it in awe and wonder, so to even be offered this opportunity feels like a real milestone moment.\" Brit Awards chairwoman Stacey Tang said the move to Manchester had \"enabled us to think about how we do things in such a brilliant and different way, so I am delighted that Matthew accepted the invitation to design the award for next year's show\". \"We couldn't be more pleased with what Matthew has created,\" she added.

An amendment to the Crime and Policing Bill announced on Wednesday would enable \"authorised testers\" to assess models for their ability to generate illegal child sexual abuse material (CSAM) prior to their release. Technology Secretary Liz Kendall said the measures would \"ensure AI systems can be made safe at the source\" - though some campaigners argue more still needs to be done. It comes as the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) said the number of AI-related CSAM reports had doubled over the past year. The charity, one of only a few in the world licensed to actively search for child abuse content online, said it had removed 426 pieces of reported material between January and October 2025. This was up from 199 over the same period in 2024, it said. Its chief executive, Kerry Smith , welcomed the government's proposals, saying they would build on its longstanding efforts to combat online CSAM. \"AI tools have made it so survivors can be victimised all over again with just a few clicks, giving criminals the ability to make potentially limitless amounts of sophisticated, photorealistic child sexual abuse material,\" she said. \"Today's announcement could be a vital step to make sure AI products are safe before they are released.\" Rani Govender, policy manager for child safety online at the NSPCC, welcomed the measures for encouraging firms to have more accountability and scrutiny over their models and child safety. \"But to make a real difference for children, this cannot be optional,\" she said. \"Government must ensure that there is a mandatory duty for AI developers to use this provision so that safeguarding against child sexual abuse is an essential part of product design.\" The government said its proposed changes to the law would also equip AI developers and charities to make sure AI models have adequate safeguards around extreme pornography and non-consensual intimate images. Child safety experts and organisations have frequently warned AI tools developed, in part, using huge volumes of wide-ranging online content are being used to create highly realistic abuse imagery of children or non-consenting adults. Some,including the IWFand child safety charity Thorn, have said these risk jeopardising efforts to police such material by making it difficult to identify whether such content is real or AI-generated. Researchers have suggested there is growing demand for these images online,particularly on the dark web, and that some are beingcreated by children. Earlier this year, the Home Office said the UK would be the first country in the world to make it illegal to possess, create or distribute AI tools designed to create child sexual abuse material (CSAM), with a punishment of up to five years in prison. Ms Kendall said on Wednesday that \"by empowering trusted organisations to scrutinise their AI models, we are ensuring child safety is designed into AI systems, not bolted on as an afterthought\". \"We will not allow technological advancement to outpace our ability to keep children safe,\" she said. Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips said the measures would also \"mean legitimate AI tools cannot be manipulated into creating vile material and more children will be protected from predators as a result\".

New College Swindon launched the £1.5m EV Training Centre in partnership with local garages. Secretary of State for Transport and Swindon South MP, Heidi Alexander - a former student at the college - opened the facility and said it will help train the \"next generation of workers in Swindon\". The Independent Garage Association has projected the UKcould face a shortfall of EV techniciansof more than 29,000 by 2035 as production of EV vehicles outstrips the qualified workforce. About 10 courses will be run at the centre, allowing students to qualify for a number of EV roles. Student ambassador Elisa, 16, said the new training centre \"is a good place to start for sustainability\". She said: \"Hopefully it can be the start of it [sustainability] expanding across the college and the country\". Elisa said protecting the planet is \"important\" to her and her friends. \"It is our future. If nothing happens now it could change everything,\" she added. Mandy Buxton, head of business development and solutions at New College, is part of the team working in partnership with local garages and businesses to find out the skills needed. She said the businesses she talks to are \"screaming out\" for staff qualified to work on electric vehicles. Ms Buxton said the college wants to be at the \"forefront of providing\" the next generation of EV technicians who will have the skills to \"go out into the workforce and deliver\". When the students first looked around the new centre \"the buzz was amazing\", said technical trainer Chris Priest. He said students would study electric vehicle training level 1-4, which included diagnostics, as well as autonomous vehicles. \"Its not just electric vehicles, it's the future of autonomous driving as well,\" he added. Alex Stroud, who works for local new and used car dealership Fish Brothers, said the training centre is \"so exciting for future students and our future employees\". The company has worked closely with New College and donated the electric vehicles that students will work on within the training centre. Ms Stroud recently met prospective students and said there is a skills gap generally within the motor trade but particularly within the field of technicians who carry out MOTs and repairs on EVs. She added: \"The motor trade is very male dominated, so we're also really keen on [encouraging] more women into the workforce.\" The sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans will be banned in the UK from 2030 in line with the government's commitment to become carbon neutral by 2050. Heidi Alexander said: \"It's great to see the college moving into the 21st Century and making sure we're training up the next generation of workers in Swindon.\" She said the transition to net zero is going to be \"vital\" to the UK economy. This week the Conservative Partypledged to scrap net zero goals, something the Reform partyhas already done. Follow BBC Wiltshire onFacebook,XandInstagram.

Residents push depleted motorcycles through the city's dusty roads, frustrated by the fuel blockade that has paralysed Mali for more than two months. Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), a jihadist, al-Qaeda-affiliated militia, has been attacking tankers bringing fuel into Mali, broadening its years-long insurgency to include economic warfare. JNIM's fighters have kidnapped drivers and torched more than 100 trucks bound for Bamako. Daily life has been upended for millions of Malians - schools and universities had to close, food prices have surged and hospitals are battling power cuts. The fuel shortage has sparked concern outside of Mali, with the US urging Americans not to travel to Mali and France advising its citizens in the West African country to leave as soon as possible. One defining image of the crisis is lengthy queues building up outside petrol stations. \"We're here waiting for fuel, and we've been here for more than four days now,\" Sidi Djiré, a taxi driver waiting at a petrol station in Bamako, tells the BBC. Mr Djiré says he hopes Mali's military-led government solves the crisis soon, because \"whether you're a vendor or a teacher, everyone's work has been affected\". At some forecourts in Bamako, motorists are met by a note bearing three, exasperating words - \"no fuel today\". Many delivery and bus drivers have resorted to sleeping at petrol stations in the hope of being the first to refuel once supplies come in. And with public transport fares tripling in some parts of the capital, some passengers have ditched the bus completely and are walking long distances to work. At Bamako's Baco Djicoroni market, customer Assitan Diarra says that food prices have tripled. \"Times are really tough right now. But what can we do? We are at war. We pray that God brings ease and peace to our country,\" Ms Diarra says. Traders tell the BBC prices have increased because transport costs have surged and the supply of imported goods has dwindled. \"The goods we used to get easily are no longer easily accessible due to the lack of transportation. For those of us who sell food products, the fuel shortage makes access to supplies difficult,\" Amadou Traoré says. Behind the chaos appears to be a carefully orchestrated plan. The junta had popular support when it seized power five years ago, promising to deal with the long-running security crisis, prompted by a separatist rebellion in the north, which was then hijacked by Islamist militants like JNIM. But the Islamist insurgency has continued, and has made much of the north and east of the country ungovernable. JNIM has intensified its attacks in this area over the past year, and the fuel blockade marks a significant escalation from its usual hit-and-run ambushes. Mali is landlocked, so fuel supplies must be brought in by road from neighbouring states, such as Senegal and Ivory Coast. By cutting off fuel - the lifeblood of transport, electricity, and logistics - JNIM is forcing the government into a defensive position. The blockade also points to the geographic expansion of its insurgency, as JNIM's fighters are targeting highways linking Mali to its neighbours to the west and south. The fuel has had a large impact on hospitals - diesel shortages mean many health facilities cannot run generators for long and therefore experience power cuts that threaten emergency services. AtKalaban Coro Health Centre, medics are even struggling to show up for their shifts. \"Our personnel must be prompt and punctual in reporting to duty, but it has become extremely difficult for them to secure fuel just to commute to work,\" Dr Issa Guido tells the BBC. Commuting has also been a problem for teachers and students. As a result, schools and universities were ordered to shut for two weeks. They reopened on Monday, but staff in some rural areas still reportedly failed to travel to work. The havoc has touched millions of lives - and Malians are quietly raising questions about the government's capacity to respond. In an attempt to ease the crisis, the junta had announced a series of emergency measures. Army trucks loaded with soldiers have been escorting fuel convoys from the borders to the capital, however, the operations are fraught with security risks and some of convoys have been attacked regardless of the army's presence. The government has also signed an emergency fuel supply agreement with Russia, reports say. State media says Bamako is negotiating with Moscow for both refined petroleum imports and technical assistance to secure transport routes. Officials insist the situation is under control, but critics accuse the junta of being reactive, rather than proactive. The fuel shortage is a double-edged sword for the government, headed by coup leader Colonel Assimi Goïta. On one hand, his regime can portray itself as a victim of jihadism, rallying nationalistic support and justifying tighter security measures. On the other, the blockade has exposed the government's weakening reach beyond Bamako and undermined public confidence in a regime that came to power promising to tackle jihadism. The fuel shortage has also increased the country's reliance on Russia. Mercenary groups from Russia have supported Col Goïta's government sinceFrench and UN troops left, and further dependence could draw Mali further into Moscow's sphere of influence, potentially alienating Western aid and investment. Relations with the US and European Union are already strained, while ties with France have virtually been severed. But for ordinary Malians, geopolitics mean little when you are faced with unaffordable food prices and cannot get to work. Amidou Diallo, a welder who has been fruitlessly searching for fuel for his generator, fears the shortages could lead to an increase in crime and a worsened security situation. \"We're facing a crisis,\" he tells the BBC. \"If it continues like this, other problems may arise - and that could give people dangerous ideas.\" Go toBBCAfrica.comfor more news from the African continent.

The lone \"nay\" came from the Republican lawmaker from Louisiana, Clay Higgins, who defied his party saying his vote was a principled \"NO\". \"What was wrong with the bill three months ago is still wrong today,\" Higgins wrote on X. \"It abandons 250 years of criminal justice procedure in America.\" The resounding vote in favour of the Epstein bill, 427-1, marks a rare moment of bipartisanship on Capitol Hill. Hours later, the US senate too approved the legislation, clearing the way for the final act - President Donald Trump's signature. For Higgins, safeguarding the personal information of Epstein's many victims was the primary issue with the legislation. \"As written, this bill reveals and injures thousands of innocent people – witnesses, people who provided alibis, family members, etc,\" he wrote on X. \"If enacted in its current form, this type of broad reveal of criminal investigative files, released to a rabid media, will absolutely result in innocent people being hurt.\" Higgins said he would support the bill if it were to be amended by the Senate, which Republican majority leader John Thune had already suggested was unlikely. \"When a bill comes out of the House 427 to 1 and the president said he's going to sign it, I'm not sure that amending it is in the cards,\" Thune said before the Senate's unanimous approval for the bill on Tuesday. Prior to the House passing the legislation, only four Republicans had joined all Democrats in signing a petition to force a vote - Thomas Massie, Lauren Boebert, Nancy Mace and Marjorie Taylor Greene. But it achieved overwhelming Republican support after President Trump dropped his opposition to a vote. Higgins has represented Louisiana's third district since 2017 and is widely regarded as one of the most conservative members of Congress, according to his website. His holdout vote in the wake of 200-plus members of his party voting otherwise is not the first time he has taken an unorthodox stance. In 2024, House Republicans voted to censure Higgins for offensive remarks he made on social media after he called Haiti \"the nastiest country in the western hemisphere\" and referred to Haitians as \"eating pets\" and \"slapstick gangsters\". \"All these thugs better get their mind right and their ass out of our country before January 20th,\" Higgins wrote. Facebook removed two posts from Higgins in 2020, after he wrote he would \"drop any 10 of you where you stand\", referring to any armed protesters that might attend a Louisiana demonstration against police brutality. Facebook told Business Insider at the time the posts \"were removed for violating our policies against inciting violence\". Before Congress, Higgins was a member of Louisiana's St Landry's Parish Sheriff's Office. He resigned in 2016 amid backlash about a controversial anti-crime video where he was seen holding a rifle and making threats against gang members. The BBC has contacted Higgins's office for comment."}

The team had pledged to the changein Octoberafter public pressure from the Canadian company, citing pro-Palestinian protests during the Vuelta a Espana in September, many of which were directed towards Israel-Premier Tech. Canadian rider Derek Gee had also cancelled his contract with the team days before the Vuelta, citing \"serious concerns\". In a statement, agricultural products company Premier Tech said: \"Although we took notice of the team's decision to change its name for the 2026 season, the core reason for Premier Tech to sponsor the team has been overshadowed to a point where it has become untenable for us to continue as a sponsor. \"Premier Tech has decided to step down as co-title sponsor of the team taking effect immediately.\" Premier Tech had said in September it \"expects the team to evolve towards a new name excluding 'Israel', leading to a new identity and branding for the team\". And whilst the team had been in the process of reorganising after owner Canadian-Israeli billionaire Sylvan Adams decided to step back from day-to-day operations, a new lead figure and structure was still set to be announced. In response to Premier Tech's decision, the team told BBC Sport on Friday it was \"unable to comment on the announcement made by Premier Tech\". The team added: \"However, as sponsor discussions continue to take place, with existing and potential partners, the team is as motivated as ever for the coming season. \"An announcement regarding the new team identity and its sponsors is expected in the coming weeks.\" Israel-Premier Tech have been targeted by pro-Palestinian protestors relating to the Israel-Gaza war, which was sparked by a Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, during which about 1,200 people were killed. Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 68,800 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Although not directly referenced in statements, Gee said riding for the team \"weighed heavily on his conscience\", and said he is the subject of a 30m euros (£26m) damages claim for breach of contract from the team. Gee, a popular figure in the sport, was considered one of the team's best riders, having finished fourth in May's Giro d'Italia. Adams' involvement in Israeli politics is well known, telling BBC Sport in 2020 he is a\"self-appointed ambassador to Israel\". He supported Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government on a trip to the White House to oversee the signing of an accord between arab nations and Israel during US President Donald Trump's first term in 2020. The protests during the Vuelta affected several of the 21 stages across the three-week Grand Tour, including the cancellation of the final stage in Madrid, when protestors blocked the course with barriers and some riders were pushed from their bikes. On stage five during the team time trial, a banner was unfurled in front of Israel-Premier Tech as they approached at speed, taking four of eight riders out of the stage. Alongside the concerns of Premier Tech, team bike supplier Factor also asked for changes to be made for them to continue their association with the team in 2026.

Sustainable Devizes first held a Devizes Swap Shop in 2022 from a small stand in the town's market place, with a couple of tables of books and toys. The event, which is now held at least three times a year and is attended by hundreds of people, is taking place later at St James' Church. People are encouraged to donate unwanted toys, games, crafts, books, houseplants and school uniforms, and can take anything away for free in exchange. Helen Langford now volunteers at the swap shops after first using the service herself. \"One time, I found it quite moving because I remember a particular lady who had a few children with her and she was basically saying, 'I couldn't have got through Christmas without this', and I knew it was making a really big difference,\" she said. \"For me personally, I was driven by trying to be more eco-friendly and trying to spend less, waste less and see stuff used for its whole life, rather than just used for a  season and out the door.\" The founder, Sam Drury Shore, said: \"The reason I love the swaps is the co-benefits they bring. \"Our initial motivation was very much about reducing waste, and trying to gently change people's mindsets around consumption. \"But with the cost of living crisis, we can really see that the swaps are a huge help to families - hopefully without it seeming patronising or stigmatising as our framing is 'you are helping by reducing waste', rather than 'you are being helped by being given free stuff'.\" The Devizes Swap Shop is taking place at St James' Church from 10:00 GMT.

Officials are pleading with citizens to conserve water as the crisis deepens. President Masoud Pezeshkian has warned that if there is not enough rainfall soon, Tehran's water supply could be rationed. But he said that even rationing might not be enough to prevent a disaster. \"If rationing doesn't work,\" Pezeshkian said, \"we may have to evacuate Tehran.\" His comments have prompted criticism in Iranian newspapers and on social media. Former Tehran mayor Gholamhossein Karbaschi called the idea \"a joke\" and said \"evacuating Tehran makes no sense at all\". Iran's meteorological officials say no rainfall is expected over the next 10 days. Meanwhile, the water crisis is already affecting daily life in the capital. \"I'm planning to buy water tankers to use for toilets and other necessities,\" a woman in Tehran told BBC Persian. In the summer, Iranian rapper Vafa Ahmadpoor posted a video on social media showing a kitchen tap with no running water. \"It's been four or five hours,\" he said. \"I've bought bottled water just to be able to go to the toilet.\" The manager of the Latian Dam, one of Tehran's main water sources, says it now holds less than 10% of its capacity. The nearby Karaj Dam — which supplies water to both Tehran and Alborz provinces — is in a similarly dire condition. \"I have never seen this dam so empty since I was born,\" an elderly local resident told Iranian state TV. According to Mohammad-Ali Moallem, the manager of the Karaj Dam, rainfall has plummeted dramatically. \"We had a 92% decrease in rain compared to last year,\" he said. \"We have only eight per cent water in our reservoir — and most of it is unusable and considered 'dead water.'\" The government is now pinning its hopes on late autumn rain, but forecasts are bleak. Iran's Minister of Energy, Abbas Ali Abadi, has warned the situation could soon force authorities to cut water supplies. \"Some nights we might decrease the water flow to zero,\" he said. Officials have also announced plans to penalise households and businesses that consume excessive amounts of water. Iran's energy minister Ali Abadi has said Tehran's water crisis is not only due to a lack of rainfall. He blamed water leakage caused by the capital's century-old water infrastructure and even pointed to the recent 12-day war with Israel. During that conflict, Israel targeted the northern Tehran neighbourhood of Tajrish on 15 June.Afterwards videos showed heavy flooding in the area. The day after the strike, the Israel Defence Forces said it had targeted Iranian military \"command centres\". But the crisis extends far beyond the capital. The head of Iran's National Centre for Climate and Drought Crisis Management, Ahmad Vazifeh, has warned that, apart from Tehran, dams in many other provinces — including West Azerbaijan, East Azerbaijan and Markazi — are also in a \"worrying state\", with water levels in the single-digit percentages. In Mashhad, Iran's second-largest city, officials are sounding the alarm as well. The Governor of Khorasan Razavi Province in north-east Iran, said the water reserves in Mashhad's dams have dropped to \"less than eight percent,\" warning that the province faces a \"mega-challenge of drought.\" CEO of Mashhad's Water and Wastewater Company put the figure even lower. \"The storage level of the city's main dam is below three percent,\" Hossein Esmaeilian said. \"Only three percent of the combined capacity of Mashhad's four water-supplying dams — Torogh, Kardeh, Doosti, and Ardak — remains. Apart from Doosti Dam, the other three are out of operation.\" Iran's water crisis has been decades in the making. Even Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has repeatedly acknowledged the looming threat — speaking about water shortages in his Nowruz addresses in 2011 and on other occasions in the following years. Today, Tehran, Karaj and Mashhad — home to more than 16 million people combined — are facing the real possibility of their taps running dry."}

State authorities say inmates may use the strong-smelling paste to disguise contraband substances or brew alcohol behind bars. But Andre McKechnie argues that the ban, in place in the state of Victoria since 2006, denies him the right to \"enjoy his culture as an Australian\", according to court documents seen by AFP and AP. McKechnie was handed a life sentence for stabbing a property developer to death in Queensland in the 1990s. He served part of his sentence in Queensland before being transferred to Victoria. In his lawsuit against Victoria's Department of Justice and Corrections, the agency managing the state's prisons, the 54-year-old said he wanted the Vegemite ban overturned. He also wants prison authorities to declare that they \"failed to provide food adequate to maintain [his] wellbeing\". The case is scheduled for trial next year, AP reported. A much-loved breakfast spread for some, Vegemite has acquired controversial accolades since it first hit shop shelves in Australia in 1923. The thick, brown spread - made primarily from yeast extract - was invented in the Victorian capital of Melbourne more than a century ago as an alternative to the British spread Marmite. In 2022, Melbourne declared the smell of Vegemite wafting from a factory in the city a \"significant\" aspect of the city's cultural heritage. However, the spread's polarising taste has landed it in the Disgusting Food Museum in Sweden - alongside natto, stinky tofu and monkey brains. Vegemite sparked an international dispute in April this year when an Australian cafe owner in Canada was told toremove jars of the condimentfrom his shelves as it did not comply with local health regulations. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese intervened in the row, saying it was \"rather odd\" that Canada allowed the sale of Vegemite's \"rubbish\" rival product Marmite. The Canadian agency soon changed course and allowed the cafe owner to continue selling the spread."}

Having finished second in their qualifying group courtesy of an emphatic7-1 triumph over North Macedonia- their biggest win since 1978 - Craig Bellamy's side will play the last-four encounter on home soil. They will face either Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo or Republic of Ireland in that fixture on 26 March. Former Wales striker Rob Earnshaw believes the Dragons will relish a tie against any opponent on the back of their most recent result at Cardiff City Stadium. \"I know Craig Bellamy, I played with him and his mentality is 'give us whoever, it doesn't matter',\" Earnshaw told BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast. \"A lot of people were saying last night, 'do we really want Republic of Ireland as it's that derby feel?'. I think a lot of people didn't. But for me, that would be incredible. \"So it's one of those, yes, we'll take Kosovo or Bosnia and Albania are not bad and the Republic of Ireland, of course, they're a very good team so they'll be difficult. \"But you just feel that we'll take anybody right now and it doesn't matter, and a lot of that is down to Craig Bellamy.\" Highlights: Wales 7-1 North Macedonia Wales sit 32nd in the Fifa world rankings, with Republic of Ireland 59th, Albania 63rd, Bosnia-Herzegovina 71st and Kosovo 80th. Albaniaenjoyed a strong qualifying campaign, with their only defeats coming at the hands of Group K winners England, who claimed maximum points without conceding a single goal. Burnley's Armando Broja and Lazio's Elseid Hysaj are among the Red and Blacks' more notable names, although it was former Inter Milan, Barcelona and Watford forward Rey Manaj who topped their scoring chart in qualifying with three goals. It is worth noting that Albania have never qualified for a World Cup, although they featured at Euro 2016 and Euro 2024, failing to reach the knockout stages on both occasions. As Slovenia and Sweden endured torrid campaigns, with both failing to win a qualifying match, Group B was a straight shootout between Switzerland andKosovo. The Swiss ended the six-game campaign three points clear of Kosovo, whose one defeat came at the hands of the group winners. Kosovo include former Manchester City goalkeeper Arijanet Muric and Mallorca's Vedat Muriqi - his nation's all-time top scorer - in a squad targeting a first major tournament appearance. Two games from the World Cup - but who will Wales face? 'I always have a point to prove' - Wales' Johnson 'Close to perfect' - Bellamy revels in Wales masterclass Bosnia-Herzegovinalost just once in qualifying, and claimed a point more than Wales managed in their eight games, but still finished two points adrift of Group H winners Austria. They were 13 minutes away from clinching a spot at the World Cup, but Michael Gregoritsch's equaliser for the Austrians ensured the pair drew in the final game of qualifying and Ralf Rangnick's team topped the group. Wales have failed to beat the Bosnians in four attempts but did have a memorable defeat against Zmajevi - the Dragons - as they qualified for Euro 2016 under Chris Coleman despite losing. As his country's all-time top goalscorer and most-capped player, former Manchester City forward Edin Dzeko, now at Fiorentina, is unquestionably Bosnia-Herzegovina's standout player. The 39-year-old was his team's top scorer in qualifying with five goals. And finally, we haveRepublic of Ireland. Having taken just one point from their opening three qualifiers, Heimir Hallgrímsson's side surged into the play-offs with successive wins against Armenia, Portugal and Hungary. Troy Parrott netted both goals against Euro 2016 winners Portugal before bagging a hat-trick - with the third goal coming in the 96th minute - as the Irish stunned Hungary to take second spot in Group F in dramatic fashion. Talisman Seamus Coleman played a vital role in his side's resurgence while Brentford goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher has made the number one jersey his own. The Republic of Ireland are winless in their past four meetings with Wales, losing three of those, although James McClean broke the hearts of the Red Wall as Martin O'Neill's men won a crucial World Cup qualifier at Cardiff City Stadium in 2017."}

Not only was there a record seven regular-season games played overseas this season, they were played across five countries. And the NFL ended this season's slate of international games by ticking off two more iconic venues, staging its first games at Berlin's Olympiastadion and Real Madrid's Bernabeu Stadium. Henry Hodgson, general manager of NFL UK and Ireland, told BBC Sport the games \"remain a very important part of our growth internationally\". So what's next for America's biggest sports league as it aims to capitalise on its growing popularity around the world? The NFL's first regular-season game to be played abroad was in Mexico in 2005 and the UK has hosted annual games since 2007. Germany was added to the schedule in 2022 but the league's desire totruly go globalbegan with South America staging its first game in Brazil in 2024. Four European countries hosted games this season - with Ireland and Spain having their first - and in 2026Australia will host the first NFL gameoutside the Americas or Europe. There will again be games inBraziland Germany, while the NFL has had a long-term commitment to play three in London each year. Commissioner Roger Goodell has also said the NFL will return to Mexico, with the Estadio Azteca having been renovated for the 2026 World Cup, although there has been no official confirmation yet. If announced, that would make it seven international games for 2026. Under the NFL's current Collective Bargaining Agreement, it can play up to 10 per year and the league has been assessing potential host cities worldwide, including the Middle East and Asia. What football can learn from NFL's international games The Jacksonville Jaguars have played in London each year from 2013, and twice in 2023. They are the only team solely responsible for organising an international game so keep all revenues from the event, and team president Mark Lamping told BBC Sport that a Wembley game is more profitable than one in Jacksonville. But rumours of the Jaguars one day relocating to London were quashed when the Florida franchise committed to a major renovation project of their own stadium costing $1.4bn (£1.1bn). While that work takes place, the capacity will be reduced in 2026 and the Jags must play elsewhere in 2027,reportedly in Orlando,,externalso they have the option to playtwo games internationally in 2026 and three in 2027.,external \"We haven't determined the number yet,\" said Lamping. \"First we have to determine where we'll play in 2027, then if there are scheduling difficulties, that may lead us one way or the other.\" Tickets did not sell as quickly for this season's London games, but come gameday the attendances at Tottenham and Wembley matched previous years. Despite there being more international games, many European fans still travel to the UK. BBC Sport spoke to several Germans who attended a London game as they have never managed to get a ticket for a game in their home nation, such is the demand in their homeland. \"NFL fans across Europe are being served incredibly well,\" added Hodgson. \"There's lots of opportunities to visit different countries and watch NFL games, but I think there's [still] more than enough appetite for fans to come and visit us.\" The NFL launched a global markets programme in 2022, giving teams marketing rights in specific countries, and more have rights in Germany than any other country (11). Two of them played in the Berlin game on 9 November, whenthe Indianapolis Colts beat the Atlanta Falconsin overtime, while the other nine hosted events in the German capital that weekend. Munich and Frankfurt have previously staged games, and the NFL has agreed to return to Berlin in 2027 and 2029. The league is set to announce which city will host games in 2026 and 2028, and Alexander Steinforth, general manager of NFL Germany, said: \"I think we'll have a good mix of two cities going forward.\" He added that teams are \"queueing up\" to play in Germany and joked his team \"wouldn't complain\" about having multiple games, but they are also \"rallying behind the NFL's efforts to really grow the game internationally, which includes far beyond Germany. \"We know the value of each international game and are supporting our international colleagues to identify those destinations that make the most sense for us as a league.\" 'What type of rugby is this?' - Madrid's first experience of the NFL Several NFL officials have said thePittsburgh Steelers' win in Dublinin September surpassed expectations and the league is still evaluating whether to go back to Ireland. Commissioner Goodell said the NFL will return to Spain after the Miami Dolphins beat the Washington Commanders in overtime on Sunday, despite it being what ESPN's Kalyn Kahler called \"a nascent market\". The Dolphins have marketing rights in Spain but Kahler spoke to locals in Madrid's main plaza last week and \"for the most part, they had no idea what the Miami Dolphins or the NFL were\". \"Multiple people asked me 'que tipo de rugby es' - what type of rugby is this?\" She added that Spain is \"not at the level of football knowledge or fandom that the UK is or Germany, Mexico or even Brazil. I feel like this market was their biggest experiment [yet].\" Will NFL return to Dublin? Rodgers '100%' thinks so The NFL has also looked at playing in Barcelona, with the Nou Camp seen as another iconic stadium the league could tick off once it has been fully renovated. The league has carried out site visits in several cities, including Paris and Abu Dhabi, and work in potential host markets begins years in advance. For example, the New Orleans Saints are the only team with marketing rights in France while the San Francisco 49ers are one of three operating in the UAE, and both are engaging with local communities to build interest there. \"We're monitoring and examining locations around the world,\" added Hodgson. \"People often focus on 'is this stadium viable?'. But actually, the important thing for us is, 'are those markets going to be viable, not just to play a game in but to grow a fanbase?'. That really is where the decision gets made.\" Broncos sack masters & could Chiefs miss play-offs? Best of NFL week 11 Get American Football news sent straight to your phone"}

The Senate sent the bill to President Donald Trump's desk to sign into law, a day after the House of Representatives approved it in a 427-1 vote. Trump has said he will sign the measure, after abruptly reversing course on Sunday and urging fellow Republicans to support disclosure of the records as a backbench revolt brewed among rank-and-file members who demanded transparency. The Epstein files are documents from criminal investigations into the financier, including transcripts of interviews with victims and witnesses, and items seized in raids of his properties. US Attorney General Pam Bondi said on Wednesday morning when asked about the Epstein files during an unrelated news conference: \"We'll continue to follow the law with maximum transparency, while protecting victims.\" It came a day after survivors of Epstein spoke in support of the measure at the US Capitol. One of them said they had suffered \"institutional betrayal\" for years. Senate Majority Leader John Thune told CNN that he expected the upper chamber to receive the bill from the lower one on Wednesday morning, after which the bill would be passed and then sent to Trump for the presidential signature. Trump said the timing did not matter to him and has continued to cast the issue as a distraction. \"I just don't want Republicans to take their eyes off all of the Victories that we've had,\" he wrote in a social media post late on Tuesday afternoon. Trump's own historical relationship with Epstein has again been the subject of recent headlines after US lawmakers released more than 20,000 pages of documents from Epstein's estate - including some that mention Trump and other prominent figures, without indicating any wrongdoing by those individuals. Trump’s reversal at the weekend - from attacking those on Capitol Hill who wanted the files released to saying there was “nothing to hide” - surprised some in Washington. The Republican congressional leadership was caught off guard after aligning their message with the president for the past few weeks and opposing the release of the files. House Speaker Mike Johnson had repeatedly called the push to release the Epstein files a \"Democrat hoax\". But on Tuesday, he voted in support of release. Republican Clay Higgins, of Louisiana, was the only lawmaker to vote against the bill and cited his concern about “innocent people being hurt” with the release of the information. The measure had been expected to take a few days to reach the US Senate, but after the resounding afternoon vote in the House, the timeline quickly sped up. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer brought up the bill on the floor of the Senate under a procedure called unanimous consent. Because no one objected, there was no debate and no amendments added to the bill. A congressional vote was not required to release the files - Trump could have ordered the release on his own. The bill requires Attorney General Pam Bondi to release “all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials” related to Epstein and his co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell no later than 30 days after the law is enacted. Those materials include internal justice department communications, flight logs and people and entities connected to Epstein. But there are obstacles to the files being released even if Trump signs the bill as he has said he will do. For example, the bill gives Bondi the power to withhold information that would jeopardise any active federal investigation or identifies any victims. Trump recently asked the justice department to investigate Epstein's alleged links to major banks and several prominent Democrats. Epstein was found dead in his New York prison cell in 2019 in what a coroner ruled was a suicide. He was being held on charges of sex trafficking, having previously been convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008. During two criminal investigations into Epstein, thousands of documents were gathered, including transcripts of interviews with victims and witnesses. Trump and Epstein previously socialised in similar circles, but the president has repeatedly said he cut ties with Epstein many years ago, before Epstein's 2008 conviction. The president also said he was unaware of Epstein’s criminal activity. Last week, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee published three email chains, including correspondence between Epstein and Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking. Some of those make mention of Trump and other prominent figures. In one email, sent in 2011, Epstein wrote to Maxwell: “I want you to realize that that dog that hasn’t barked is Trump.. [VICTIM] spent hours at my house with him.” The White House said last week that the victim referenced in the email was prominent Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre. Giuffre, who died in April, said that she never saw Trump participate in any abuse and there is no implication of any wrongdoing by Trump or the other high-profile figures mentioned in the emails. Speaking after the vote, Giuffre's brother Sky Roberts praised her sister's role in seeking justice for Epstein survivors. \"She did it, she paved the way... She paved the way for us to come forward as advocates, for her survivor sisters to come forward, and we won't stop,\" Roberts said. Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the emails were \"selectively leaked\" by House Democrats to \"liberal media to create a fake narrative to smear President Trump\". The push for the release of the investigative files held by the Department of Justice was led by Republican Thomas Massie, a Kentucky congressman who sometimes dissents from his party, and Democrat Ro Khanna, a California congressman, both of whom introduced the legislation. Massie has faced criticism from Trump for his push to release the files, but has stood firm. “In 2030, he’s not going to be the president,” Massie said to ABC News over the weekend. He added that fellow Republicans who voted against release \"will have voted to protect paedophiles”. Another Republican who has pushed for the release of the files is House Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene. She had been a staunch supporter of Trump before the two fell out over the issue, with the president now calling her a \"traitor\". At a news conference earlier in the day on Tuesday, Greene said she was speaking up on behalf of Epstein's survivors. \"Let me tell you what a traitor is. A traitor is an American that serves foreign countries and themselves; a patriot is an American that serves the United States of America and Americans like the women standing behind me,\" Greene said. She said that the row over Epstein has been one of the \"most destructive things\" to Trump's Make America Great Again movement since his election in 2016. Survivors of Epstein’s abuse also spoke at the news conference, urging lawmakers to release the files and pushing Trump to do the same. Epstein survivor Annie Farmer said that keeping the files under wraps amounted to “institutional betrayal”. “Because these crimes were not properly investigated, so many more girls and women were harmed,” Ms Farmer said."}

The Royal Ballet and Opera (RBO) said its new model, which means ticket prices are subject to change based on audience demand, will not alter prices in customers' baskets. Wagner's Siegfried, which is being shown at the RBO between March and April 2026, saw top-end tickets rise to £425 from £370. London theatre critic Mickey-Jo Boucher said that dynamic and demand-led pricing models were \"nothing new\" in the wider theatre world. The RBO said its new pricing model, which was introduced in September, would enable the venue to \"maximise ticket revenue and support a financially sustainable future\". \"Widely adopted across theatres and cultural venues, this model allows us to respond to demand in real time while maintaining full control over pricing boundaries, including clear upper and lower limits,\" a spokesperson said. All tickets were sold at their original price for a week before any increase. Lowest priced tiers, alongside Young RBO tickets and access programmes, were excluded from demand-led pricing, the spokesperson added. The RBO, which receives £22m funding from Arts Council England each year, said it had incorporated guidance from the CMA into its new sales approach. The move follows concerns raised earlier this year, when the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) saidTicketmaster \"may have misled Oasis fans\"with unclear pricing for the band's reunion tour. Ticket sales in 2024 descended into chaos when fans paid hundreds of pounds more than they expected under a tiered pricing system. There were concerns that Ticketmaster had used \"dynamic pricing\", where ticket prices rise and fall according to demand. Following an investigation the CMA said it had \"not found evidence\" of such an algorithmic pricing system. Mr Boucher said there were pluses and minuses to demand-led pricing. \"An important thing to remember is that dynamic pricing like this can shift in both directions, with prices increasing when tickets start selling out at popular shows but also decreasing where demand is slower,\" he said. \"There is, of course, a danger that seeing these top prices will put some audience members off, but closer scrutiny almost always shows that these are indicative of the upper most pricing tiers at almost sold out shows, at the last minute.\" He added that for organised theatregoers, there was a \"wealth of great stuff to see at affordable prices\". In a snapshot look at West End prices,The Stage's 2025 ticketing surveyreported that the cheapest West End tickets had risen by almost 25% in one year, with the gap between the cheapest and most expensive tickets narrowing. In response to the survey, Society of London Theatre (SOLT) and UK Theatre Co-CEO Hannah Essex said: \"Across the UK, theatre remains vibrant and affordable, with attendance up by 4% since 2019. In UK Theatre venues, most tickets are sold for less than £36, a quarter for £24.50 or less, and 99.6% cost below £100. \"Theatres continue to keep prices affordable and audiences at the heart of what they do – ensuring that great live theatre remains open and welcoming to everyone, everywhere.\" Update 17 November:This article has been updated to include additional detail about theatre ticket prices from Society of London Theatre (SOLT) & UK Theatre.

She promised the case would be conducted in a transparent and disciplined manner. Club Pulse, in the eastern town of Kocani, was packed with young Macedonians attending a concert by a popular hip-hop duo when sparks from pyrotechnic devices set fire to the ceiling. Prosecutors told the trial that years of failings had turned the club into a death trap. Three former mayors of Kocani, the nightclub's owner and public licensing officials are among those charged. They are accused of endangering public safety by allowing an unsafe venue to operate. The judge warned the court that the trial could last for \"five months or five years\". Defence lawyers attempted to delay the start of proceedings due to the charges being merged into a single case. The judge rebuffed them, ruling this did \"not violate any rights of the parties\". At the time of the tragedy, authorities said only one proper exit was functioning at the club as the back door had been locked. Sparks from the pyrotechnics spread quickly on the club's ceiling, which had been made of flammable material. About 500 people were inside the club at the time, leaving 59 dead and some 200 others injured. Four of the injured died later. Many were unable to escape because of blocked exits. Outrage after the fire prompted protests in the Macedonian capital Skopje and elsewhere, with victims' families organising local marches in Kocani itself. Another protest entitled \"March of the Angels\" took place in Skopje days before the trial began, organised under a Macedonian social media campaign called \"Who's Next?\". Prosecutors told the trial that the Kocani disaster was not the result of one person's actions or mistakes - rather it arose out of a series of institutional failures and a lack of responsibility. None of the defendants had wanted to face up to the danger that had been there for years, according to prosecutor Borche Janev. Prosecutors allege that licences for the club were issued unlawfully, inspections were not carried out and overcrowding was allowed at the venue. Another allegation is that there was no permit for the band to set off the pyrotechnic devices that started the fire. \"If we remain silent and lose the truth... we will never have the strength as a society to embark on a path to healing,\" Janev was quoted by local media as telling the court."}

The gang invaded the Government Girls Comprehensive Secondary School in Maga, Kebbi State, at around 04:00 local time (0300 GMT) on Monday, they said. The attackers \"engaged police personnel on duty in a gun duel\" before scaling the perimeter fence and seizing the students from their hostel, a statement said. One member of staff was killed while trying to protect the students. A second sustained gunshot wounds and is now receiving treatment. Eyewitnesses described a large group of attackers, known locally as bandits, who arrived firing sporadically to cause panic. Residents told the BBC that the gunmen subsequently marched a number of girls into nearby bushland. The police said they had deployed \"additional police tactical units, alongside military personnel and vigilante groups\" to the area. A coordinated search and rescue operation is underway in surrounding forests and suspected escape routes. Over the past decade, schools in northern Nigeria have become frequent targets for armed groups, who often carry out abductions to seek ransom payments or leverage deals with the government. As well as trying to crack down on the kidnappers, Nigeria has also banned the payment of ransoms in an attempt to make it less lucrative. This is the first major school abduction since March 2024, when more than 200 pupils were seized from a school in Kuriga, Kaduna state. The attack in Kebbi State highlights the persistent security crisis plaguing the region, leaving families in Maga in a state of fearful exhaustion as they wait and hope for their daughters' safe return.

Aye, same. But have you watched it with Alasdair Lamont's radio commentary, accompanied by Celine Dion's Titanic? It's highly recommended. Once you've finished replaying the highlights on loop, once the tear ducts have all dried up and once Alexa has frozen from the repeats of We Have A Dream, it's about time to think about what qualification means. For younger fans, it's the ultimate unknown. Unchartered waters. Scotland’s men at the World Cup for the first time in our lifetimes. We're being told to savour this moment. If Tuesday’s scenes are anything to go by, that won't be an issue. But what are we actually suppose to be looking forward to? BBC Sport Scotland asks the key questions as our attention fully turns to North America. How has world changed since Scotland were last at men's finals? Is Clarke now Scotland's greatest-ever manager? 'Sir Steve', tears and greatest night of lives - what Scotland fans said You thought last summer was the holiday of a lifetime? Strap yourselves in. This isn't a wee jaunt to Germany. A flight which can take just a matter of hours. A country which can be driven to. An opening day venue which can be walked or cycled to. Flocks of fans aren't rushing to travel agents in the same way they did two years ago, because that would just be bonkers. The group stages are split into three regions of west, central and east -you can read more on that- but we're talking about a vast continent. More than 1,200 miles separate Los Angeles and Vancouver in the west, there are 1,700 miles between Kansas City and Mexico City in the central region, and 1,500 miles between Miami and Boston in the east. We'll find out which region the games are in after the draw on 5 December. One Scottish travel firm has already released a number of World Cup packages, ranging from three nights in New York for £2,659 per person to 11 nights in California for £3,999. Flights are currently available from Edinburgh to Philadelphia the day before the tournament begins, coming back the day after the group games end, for just over £700. Anyone about for a backie on their motorbike or willing to give a callycode? Now we're getting to the serious stuff. It's going to be one helluva journey, no matter the mode of transport, so we need something to tune into and something to be sick of hearing before we've even departed these shores. In 1998, it was Del Amitri and their - unsuccessful - cry of Don't Come Home Too Soon. The honour of releasing the song synonymous with a World Cup squad can be compared with performing a James Bond theme song. In fact, it's maybe a bigger honour than that. Diamonds are... what? Ally's Tartan Army all the way. So, who should we call on to convey our hopes and dreams? We're not short of options, with many a fine Scottish artist missing out on the chance over the years as glorious failure after glorious failure ensued. Who wouldn't want to hear Paulo Nutini and Lewis Capaldi in harmony? Susan Boyle and Sharleen Spiteri are frantically refreshing their phones awaiting the call. Belle and Sebastian, Biffy Clyro, Mogwai. Calvin Harris on the decks. It's a pitch with all the pop stars and The Proclaimers are checking everyone's credentials. OK, back to a slightly more serious question again. The highly sought-after tickets. The bad news is prices are eye-watering and Fifa's early ticket draw has already been and gone. Opened and closed before Steve Clarke's side took to Turkey for their warm-weather training camp last week - which feels a lifetime ago. More on thaton Fifa's official site.,external There will be more tickets available to the public after the draw on 5 December and of course, thousands of tickets will be made available to each participating association. Those will be for Travel Club members, but, even if you are signed up already there are no guarantees... Ach, who cares about the tickets at this stage, let's just get across the water, eh? To do so, you will need an electronic system for travel authorisation (ESTA) to enter the USA. Thiscan be done online,,externaland it will be valid for 90 days of travel. Handy, because you'll want to soak up the celebrations after Andy Robertson lifts the grand, gold gong aloft. If you don't have the required UK passport, you might need to get a visa instead, which involves a wee journey down to the US Embassy in London. An appointmentcan be sorted online.,externalBeat the queues... There are no visa requirements for Mexico, while an eTA is needed if flying into Canada. Make your own mind up on this one. The three host nations automatically enter pot one, and it goes without saying, they are the three weakest - given the other nine are the best in the business. We're due a kind draw too, surely? So, naturally, Scotland would like to draw one of the USA, Canada and Mexico. Let's just hope it goes better than the last time we faced a host nation at a major tournament... Ah, Munich. A wee look at pot two, though, and there are some decent outfits in there. Scotland can only play one other European nation in the groups, so there is a fair chance Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Japan, Senegal, Iran, South Korea, Ecuador and Australia could lie in wait. It might be best to swerve the European trio in that pot: Croatia, Switzerland and Austria. A hefty portion of pot four is still TBC. Imagine having to go through the play-offs? Wouldn't be us... Those play-offs take place in March. Which reminds us, we can rub that off the calendar. Not completely, though, because Clarke will still be calling together his band of merry men for a couple of friendlies. Scotland's opponents are as yet unknown, but we can assume the boss and the Scottish FA will be keen for decent calibre to provide something of a test. Nations' availability comes into these complex conversations, too. But what can be sure is the Tartan Army will be there to see their heroes in action before they're North America bound. It'll be another opportunity to sport the new Scotland strip, too. Most did say upon it's release the other week it was worthy of a World Cup appearance. The excitement come March will be through the roof. Truly within touching-distance territory. Just wait until the sticker album is unveiled a few weeks later... No one is swapping their shiny Scott McTominay, eh?"}

How worried should we be?", "body": "First comes the warning, that disembodied voice over the tannoy: \"Your attention please. Air siren in the city. Please move to the shelter on the minus second floor.\" Then comes the mosquito-like whine of the incoming Russian drones, massing in their hundreds just above the clouds. It's followed immediately by the rattle of anti-aircraft fire, the distant thud of explosions, then finally the ominous klaxon call of ambulance and fire sirens. This is the grim reality of night time in Kyiv and other cities across Ukraine. These are attack drones that explode on impact. Drones are now an integral part of modern warfare, but they are not confined to the battlefield. Across western Europe, far from Ukraine, unarmed drones have also been found buzzing around airports, military bases and power plants, all part of a suspected programme of \"hybrid warfare\" being waged by Russia, with some speculating they're arriving to test the resilience of certain Nato countries that are helping Ukraine. Recent drone sightings in Poland, along with a swathe spotted around critical infrastructure across Europe, including in Belgium and Denmark, have sparked fear across some Nato countries. Now, there is talk that a \"drone wall\" is to be designed to protect parts of Europe - but just how necessary is this, really? And more pertinently, how realistic? On 9 September, around 20 Russian drones overshot Ukraine and flew into Poland, forcing the closure of four airports. Nato jets were scrambled and several of the drones were shot down - the rest crashed across Poland, scattering debris in multiple regions. This was a wake-up call to Europe, marking one of the largest and most serious breaches of Nato airspace since the war in Ukraine began. Which is why discussion about a possible drone wall seems ever more pressing. \"This momentum is really driven by these recent incursions,\" explains Katja Bego, senior research fellow in the international security programme at Chatham House think tank. Drones - or to give them their official title, Uncrewed Aerial Systems (UAS) or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) - have already transformed the battle space. On the killing fields of eastern Ukraine, they tend to be small short-range ones, typically measuring around just 10 inches, and they carry lethal explosive devices. But these are not currently the threat to the rest of Europe. It is the larger drones - some of which can potentially fly well over 1,000km - that are fuelling calls for a European drone wall. Previously Russia imported a type known as Shahed 136 drones from Iran but now it produces its own version: the Geran 2. Some Gerans were among the drones that flew into Poland in September. So, what, some are now asking, if Russia one day sent over 200 drones? Or, say, 2,000? How would Nato respond - and in fact, could it respond? After all, deploying fighter jets each time would be expensive. André Rogaczewski, CEO of Netcompany, a Danish IT services firm that builds digital systems for European governments, argues: \"[It] is neither effective nor a sensible use of taxpayers' money.\" Ukraine has stepped up its own long-range drone attacks on Russian airports and critical infrastructure like petrochemical plants, bringing the war home to ordinary Russians. Then there are sea drones: uncrewed vessels that can travel either on or below the surface, as used with devastating effect by Ukraine against Russia's Black Sea fleet. But there is something that is in some ways more sinister than clearly identifiable drones used by countries that are openly at war. That is: the plague of mysterious, anonymous drones that have appeared. Sometimes these turn up in the dead of night, around Europe's airports, including one in Belgium's main airport near Brussels earlier this month. There have also been similar sightings in Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Germany and Lithuania. Unlike the clearly identifiable Russian attack drones in Ukraine, these \"civilian drones\" in Western Europe have not – so far – been armed with any explosives. But being anonymously launched, it's hard to prove where they come from or who activated them - or indeed if they are being launched from passing ships. Suspicions fall on Russia with Western intelligence officials believing Moscow is using proxies to launch these short range drones locally to cause havoc and disruption. The Kremlin denies any responsibility. Belgium is one significant target, as the home to Nato headquarters, the European Union and Euroclear (the financial clearing house that handles trillions of dollars of international transactions). There is an ongoing debate around whether Europe should release around €200bn worth of frozen Russian assets, held in Belgium, to help Ukraine. So is it a coincidence that mystery drones have appeared around Brussels and Liege airports, as well as a military base? The UK has sent a team of counter drone specialists from the RAF Regiment, deployed from RAF Leeming in North Yorkshire, to help bolster Belgium's defences against the drones. Still, the mystery drones are worrying: both because of the danger posed to aircraft as they take off and land but also because of the risk of surveillance, especially around military bases and critical infrastructure such as power plants. The plan for a drone wall is Europe's response to the threat of cross-border incursions by drones launched specifically from Russia. The wall has been described as an integrated, coordinated, multi-layered defence system stretching initially from the Baltic states to the Black Sea. It's likely to comprise a combination of radars, sensors, jamming and weapons systems to detect incoming drones - and then to track and destroy them. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas has said a new anti-drone system should be fully operational by the end of 2027. Not surprisingly, those countries keenest to see it deployed quickly - including Poland and Finland- are those geographically closest to Russia. Katja Bego believes it is necessary - and long overdue. But she adds:  \"This is not just about drones. There is really not enough in place in terms of more traditional missile defence, air defence, along the Eastern flank borders.\" Nonetheless, a drone wall is not a silver bullet for air defence. And others aren't convinced it's entirely realistic. Robert Tollast, a research fellow at Whitehall think tank The Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), argues that the idea of some \"sort of impervious wall\", is, in his words, out of the question. Yet he can still see why there are calls for it and wants to try. \"For countries that are close to the Russian border – the Baltics, Poland, Germany as well because of course they're within range of those long-range drones - it is absolutely essential to try and build something like this,\" he says. \"The idea here would be not so much to actually build a full-on wall, or something that's fully impenetrable\", agrees Ms Bego. \"It's not really possible - both in terms of the length and also just the available technologies are not 100% foolproof... But rather you're looking at a combination of things that hopefully can capture different types of drones and stop them.\" Fabian Hinz, a research fellow at The International Institute for Strategic Studies in London describes a whole menu of options to detect drones. \"You can have acoustic detection; airborne radars that can detect low flying targets really well; ground-based radars that have very short ranges against low-flying targets but [that] still work really well against high flying targets. \"You can have optical systems, infrared systems - and once the detection is done you have either soft kill or hard kill.\" Hard kill means destroying the drone, either with gunfire or missiles. Soft kill means making an incoming drone ineffective, usually through electronic means. Russia and Ukraine have been able to get around soft kills on the battlefield by packing their drones with tens of kilometres worth of fibre-optic cable that spools out as it flies, but that's not an option for something travelling hundreds of kilometres across borders. As for hard kills, Mr Hinz describes many ways of achieving them: from surface-to-air missiles to fighter jets and helicopters. \"You can have lasers which could be useful as well,\" he adds, \"but [these] are not quite the one the wonder weapon people make them out to be.\" André Rogaczewski believes jamming can be effective as an alternative. Ultimately, however, for any drone wall to be effective, it needs to be able to deal with a wide variety of aerial threats, possibly all coming at once. As tensions between Europe and Russia have risen since Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, so too have other incidents of so-called \"hybrid\" or \"grey zone\" warfare attributed to Russia, which in most cases denies them. These include cyber attacks, disinformation campaigns, incendiary devices inserted into cargo depots, surveillance and sometimes sabotage of undersea cables. And yet at a security forum in Bahrain earlier this month, Admiral Giuseppe Cavo Dragone, the Italian chairperson of Nato's Military Committee, told me that of all Nato's defence needs right now, air defence is the top priority. The first stages of the drone wall are due to be activated within months, though not all details have been finalised. Meanwhile, Nato's Allied Command Transformation (ACT) based in Norfolk, Virginia is working on longer-term solutions. This is not an easy challenge. Mr Tollast says the main challenge of the drone wall is the sheer scale of the area which needs to be protected. \"You need a huge range of tactical radars for low flying drones and larger radars for higher altitude targets, across thousands of kilometres. \"And you need cost effective interceptors and forces to be ready around the clock. It will never be watertight, and even as costs of some radars and interceptors fall, it's very unlikely to be cheap.\" The question of finance is a complex one. \"It is a really difficult defence question,\" says Mr Tollast. \"Even with rising European defence expenditure, there's still going to be a lot of competition from other sectors in defence [for that funding] - we need more ships, submarines, nuclear weapons even, satellites as well. \"So this is why a drone wall will remain this sort of slightly financially controversial issue for some people.\" It will potentially be funded from a mixture of EU money, national budgets (especially in Eastern Europe) and interest from frozen Russian assets. Initially, says Ms Bego, the drone wall referred to defences across the Eastern flank, but since the the EU has been spearheading this, they've been expanding it. \"Everyone recognises something needs to happen and there is a need to co-ordinate this and to mobilise money for this, but the who and what is very much under discussion... \"The more foolproof you would want it to be, the more expensive it gets\". As for the target date, Mr Tollast believes 2027 is very ambitious - but adds, \"they can definitely achieve more protection by then\". While all of this is going on, the task of building the wall is becoming ever harder. Because as fast as new counter-drone measures are introduced, up pops a new form of drone threat that can overcome them. This all makes it something of a new arms race. \"The development cycles for technologies in this space are hyper-accelerated, above all in conflict environments,\" says Josh Burch, co-founder of Gallos Technologies, a UK-based company that invests in security technology. \"It means that any defence against drones will rapidly be rendered outdated as aggressors adjust. \"The aggressor\", he concludes, \"will observe, adjust, repeat – until they get through\". So are we asking the wrong question altogether? Rather than building a drone wall to stop the drones, is it better to target the bases launching the drone themselves - as the old saying goes, shoot the archer, not just the arrow. \"It's one thing to become more resilient against it, but it would be much better if it did not happen at all,\" argues Ms Bego. \"And that's really around making it much clearer to Russia, or whichever actor is behind this, that this kind of behaviour crosses the line. It has consequences and comes with the costs for them. And that's important. It should really be part of this.\" But any suggestion of Nato hitting Russian targets – kinetically, as opposed to digitally in cyberspace – would be incredibly risky and escalatory. Ever since Russia carried out its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022 the challenge for Nato, and especially its most powerful member the US, has been to help Ukraine to defend itself but without getting drawn into a Nato-Russia war. Building a defensive drone wall in Europe is one thing. Attacking the places where those drones are launched from is quite another.

The first concerns around what Y2K would bring were creeping in. C'est La Vie by B*witched was number one in the charts, The Wedding Singer was the best in the box office, and the BBC's written coverage for the opening game against Brazil was on Ceefax. While the Tartan Army were healing their broken hearts with a 10p Freddo after Morocco spoiled the party in St Etienne, little did they know they'd be waiting 28 years to see their country at a men's World Cup again. 1998 was a very long time ago. Too long ago. Eight of Steve Clarke's successful squad at Hampden on Tuesday were not even born. A whole generation and then some have been envious of their elders who have experienced their national team dining at the top table. Next summer in the United States, Canada, Mexico can't come quick enough. But while Scotland have been sitting in the footballing dark, doing their best to keep their memories of France fresh, the rest of the world has kept spinning. And then some... Is Clarke now Scotland's greatest ever manager? Scotland qualify for World Cup... so what happens now? Scotland qualify for first men's World Cup in 28 years after Denmark epic Back in a time where Tony Blair was calling 10 Downing Street home and Bill Clinton was kicking about in the White House, the world wasn't revolving around the internet. Though it had been in existence for over a decade, it was largely used for work, not play. It's true potential - or danger - was lightyears away from being learned. Craig Brown's line-up wasn't being predicted, leaked or discovered online, and there certainly wasn't anyone watching Colin Hendry and his team-mates trot out at the Stade de France in their kilts on their mobile phones. That's an image, actually. Only one in four people back then actually had a mobile phone. Imagine the huddling... In fact, most fans back home were watching in smoke-filled pubs – it was nearly eight years before it was made illegal to light-up in enclosed public spaces. They watched Hendry admirably attempt his unenviable job of marking a certain Ronaldo – the world's most expensive player at the time. He'd just completed a £17m move from Barcelona to Inter Milan. At the time the fee was eye-watering, but now it might buy you a third-choice full-back. The Euro didn't come into use until the year after. And it was that year too that Scotland's first First Minister, Donald Dewar proclaimed \"today there is a new voice in the land,\" as the new parliament opened in Edinburgh. There have been six First Ministers since, and one vote on independence in 2014. Glasgow hosted the Commonwealth Games in the same year, two summers after London welcomed the world for the Olympics. Hampden hosted a few men's and women's football games during that one. Including the 1998 title, won weeks before the jaunt to France, Celtic have won 20 Scottish top-flight titles since, that one in 98 - the Scottish Premier Division league title, as it was then called – ending nine years of dominance by Rangers. Elsewhere in the sport, a 22-year-old Tiger Woods was waltzing into the golfing world. He had just one major to his name - The Masters - but would go on to win a further 14. Roger Federer hadn't even made his ATP debut, never mind won any of his 103 singles title - or his 20 majors, while Wimbledon's winner in '98, Pete Sampras earned £43,500 more than women's winner, Jana Novotna. Equal pay finally arrived in 2007 with this year's winners - Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek - both receiving £3m. Changed days. Thompson and McFadden go wild for late Scotland goals This Scotland squad will feel £3m and more having achieved what they just have. They might also have spent close to that amount on the celebrations... But this is historic. The first for a generation and then some. Aaron Hickey, Lewis Ferguson and Ben Gannon-Doak all contributed to the victory which secured the first qualification of their lifetime. Anthony Ralston, Josh Doig, Andy Irving, Connor Barron and George Hirst - all born post 1998 - were part of the bench who rampaged onto the pitch as bedlam ensued. The injured Billy Gilmour was hirpling his way to join the celebrations. Lennon Miller, Max Johnston, Nathan Patterson, Kieron Bowie, Tommy Conway, James Wilson, Ryan Porteous and Cieran Slicker have all been called upon in recent time, all of whom will also be witnessing Scotland at the World Cup for the first time. They grew up watching James McFadden, Darren Fletcher, Barry Ferguson, Scott Brown, Kenny Miller and many others in dark blue fail to reach the promised land. It's taken 10,011 days to do so. The celebrations - which will go on for a wee while yet - won't have CD's and DVD's providing the backdrop, while the milk required for the tea and coffees to heal the sore heids won't cost 34p, either. But, the more things change, the more they stay the same. Kieran Tierney reflects on the togetherness of the Scotland squad"}

But that's just it, what happened at Hampden on Tuesday wasn't a dream. Scotland really did beat Denmark, with McLean sealing it from the halfway line, to reach their first men's World Cup since 1998. As the entire country comes to terms with the monumental achievement - and the equally monumental hangovers - thoughts will inevitably turn to the finals themselves. Flights to North America and accommodation in the three host countries of the United States, Canada and Mexico will be frantically searched for and calculations done to discover potential seedings. But what do we know at this stage and when will we learn more? Time to get the wall chart drawn up and the flight comparison website loaded up. The draw for the 2026 World Cup will take place on Friday, 5 December at the Kennedy Center in Washington DC, at 17:00 GMT (12:00 local time). It will be the biggest World Cup yet, with 48 nations taking part - an expansion from 32 last time round in Qatar. Have we mentioned Scotland have qualified? The three host countries get in automatically, while nations from other confederations have had their own qualifying campaigns. The first Fifa Peace Prize will also be awarded by the organisation's president, Gianni Infantino, on the day of the draw. The tournament will last more than a month, commencing on 11 June before coming to a conclusion in New Jersey on 19 July. The 48 participating teams will be placed into pots based on Fifa rankings and confederation constraints. The teams will be divided into four pots of 12 and each of the 12 groups will have one team drawn from each pot. Pot one includes the host nations and the top nine countries in the world rankings. Pots two, three and four will include the next-best ranked teams - so, in theory, each group should be balanced. However, the six play-off winners are expected to be placed into pot four and the European teams are likely to have a higher world ranking than the automatic qualifiers. But, most importantly, where are Scotland going to be? Well, Steve Clarke's side as Group C winners have gone into pot three. Fifa could choose to seed the the play-off paths by using the highest-ranked nation within each one, though this would not affect Scotland's place in pot three. No offence to our hosts, but you're probably hoping for either USA or Canada as your top seeds. Hosts: Canada, Mexico, United States Africa: Algeria, Cape Verde, Egypt, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Morocco, Senegal, South Africa, Tunisia Asia: Australia, Iran, Japan, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Uzbekistan Europe: Austria, Belgium, Croatia, England, France, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Scotland, Spain, Switzerland South America: Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Uruguay North and Central America and the Caribbean: tbc This is where it gets really tasty. There are 16 host cities across the three countries. Here's the split: USA:Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, Houston, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, New York/New Jersey, Philadelphia, Seattle, San Francisco Mexico:Guadalajara, Mexico City, Monterrey They are split into three regions of west, central and east, but don't let that fool you into thinking there may not be much travel involved. More than 1,200 miles separate Los Angeles and Vancouver in the west region, there are 1,700 miles between Kansas City and Mexico City in the central region, and 1,500 miles between Miami and Boston in the east. That will depend upon which group they are drawn into. Group A: Guadalajara, Monterrey, Mexico City (Mexico), Atlanta (US) Group B: Toronto, Vancouver (Canada), Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle (US) Group C: Atlanta, Boston, Miami, New York/New Jersey, Philadelphia (US) Group D: Vancouver (Canada), Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle (US) Group E: Toronto (Canada), Houston, Kansas, New York/New Jersey, Philadelphia (US) Group F: Monterrey (Mexico), Dallas, Houston, Kansas (US) Group G: Vancouver (Canada), Los Angeles, Seattle (US) Group H: Guadalajara (Mexico), Atlanta, Houston, Miami (US) Group I: Toronto (Canada), Boston, New York/New Jersey, Philadelphia (US) Group J: Dallas, Kansas, San Francisco (US) Group K: Guadalajara, Mexico City (Mexico), Atlanta, Houston, Miami (USA) Group L: Toronto (Canada), Dallas, New York/New Jersey, Boston, Philadelphia (USA) While Scotland will know their opponents on Friday, 5 December they will probably have to wait 24 hours to find out their schedule. That won't be the case if they are drawn into a group with one of the hosts, as dates and venues (but not kick-off times) have been confirmed. But for all other groups, you'll know only the date and order of matches at the time of the draw. It is anticipated these kick-off times will mirror those at the Club World Cup, when the earliest games started at 17:00 BST, followed by 20:00, 23:00 and 02:00. When is the 2026 World Cup draw?

The Falmouth Repair Cafe was taking place that afternoon in the venue's foyer with local volunteers who fix a range of items from lamps to sewing machines for members of the public.

Speaking ahead of the event, US President Donald Trump said it was an \"honour\" to host Ronaldo, whose starring role in the Saudi football league has seen him become a face of the country's modernisation drive. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman wants to reduce the country's dependence on oil revenues by diversifying into other areas including sports and tourism. A White House official confirmed earlier in the day that Ronaldo would attend, but did not say if he was part of bin Salman's official delegation. Many critics claim Saudi's investment is aimed at gaining legitimacy and deflecting attention from its human rights record and the environmental impact of its oil industry - a practice referred to as 'sportswashing'. Trump used his speech at the dinner to praise closer ties with Saudi Arabia, labelling the country a \"major non-Nato ally\". Earlier in the day, Trump hosted the Saudi crown prince in the Oval Office. Turning to the Portuguese soccer star, Trump told the gathered guests: \"My son is a big fan of Ronaldo\". \"And Barron (Trump) got to meet him, and I think he respects his father a little bit more now, just the fact that I introduced you.\" Also at the dinner was tech billionaire Elon Musk, who joined other influential business leaders including Apple CEO Tim Cook. It is the first time Musk has beento the White House since stepping down as the head of the Trump administration'sDepartment for Government Efficiency (Doge) in April. A dramatic feud between Trump and the Tesla tycoonplayed out publicly for months, and included Musk announcing that he would set upa new political party. Ronaldo's attendance at the White House, meanwhile, marks one of his first known visits to the US since 2016. In the interim he has faced an allegation of sexual assault. Kathryn Mayorga alleged that Ronaldo raped her in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009, which he denied. \"I firmly deny the accusations being issued against me. Rape is an abominable crime that goes against everything that I am and believe in,\" he said in a statement in 2018. In 2019, US prosecutors said Ronaldo would not face charges because the claims could not be proven. It has been reported that the Portuguese and US national teams will play a friendly match in Atlanta in March 2026, ahead of the men's World Cup, which will be hosted across North America in the same year - and will feature Portugal. If the match is confirmed, and Ronaldo participates, it will be his first match in the US since 2014. In early 2023, Ronaldo made the jump to Saudi Arabia when he became the face of the Saudi Pro League and captain of Al Nassr - the football club owned by sovereign wealth fund PIF which is chaired by the crown prince. In an industry where players are paid extraordinary amounts of money, Ronaldo's pay deal with Saudi Arabia was astronomical. The footballer was reportedly paid $200m (£152m) a year - or more than half a million dollars a day. Then in June this year, he signed a new two-year deal for a reported total of $400m (£300m) andbecame football's first billionaire player,according to Bloomberg, with a net worth of $1.4bn. That's a lot of money for a 40-year-old footballer in the twilight of his career. But, according to Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa programme at Chatham House, Saudi Arabia has \"invested heavily in high profile events and individuals to put the kingdom on the map\" in terms of sports and tourism in its quest for modernism. Ronaldo has referred to bin Salman as \"our boss\" in an interview with broadcaster Piers Morgan. Earlier this month, he appeared at a Ministry of Tourism event in Riyadh where he talked up the kingdom's development projects and his hopes for the 2034 World Cup being held in Saudi Arabia."}

The pair had already discussed intimacy with a chronic condition, egg freezing and other \"unsexy topics\". For Sophie Richards, 29, those early conversations were just part of the daunting prospect of finding love when you haveendometriosis, which can cause infertility. The condition means cells similar to those in the lining of the womb (uterus) grow in other parts of the body, which can lead to symptoms including period pain, fatigue, plus pain in the lower tummy and back. When Sophie first met her now fiancé, Wales rugby international Dillon Lewis, she felt she had to be up front. At the time, she was freezing her eggs - a process she started because of potential fertility issues from her endometriosis. \"It can be very challenging, especially with endometriosis or something chronic, or infertility issues like I've struggled with,\" Sophie said. \"How do you bring that up to someone new and hope it doesn't scare them away?\" Despite it feeling uncomfortable, she brought the condition up soon after meeting. \"I was having to explain... about injections and surgeries, and all of that, very unsexy topics to be talking about.\" It affects around one in 10 women in Wales. There's currently no cure for the condition but there are treatments to help ease symptoms including surgery to cut away tissue, or remove part of the organs affected by endometriosis. Sophie credits fiancé Dillon with being supportive and keen to learn about the condition. \"I had plenty of hours of education from Sophie over a G&T, because Sophie was so open about it,\" he said. \"It made learning a lot easier, but she didn't mind the stupid questions as well.\" The Newport-based Dragons prop, 29, who has 57 caps for Wales, said asking questions and being open was key to offering a partner support. \"Just try to help in whichever way, like I always say 'is there anything I can do' with the answer 99% of the time being no but at least I like to ask... and get a hot water bottle every now and again,\" he added. Sophie, now a women's health advocate and podcaster, said that being with someone supportive, whatever the challenges, was vital. \"I genuinely don't think I could be with someone who didn't want to understand the endometriosis, because ultimately, I will live with it forever. It's chronic,\" she added. She wants more women to feel confident talking about the impact endometriosis can have on sex and intimacy, although acknowledged how daunting it can be. \"Now I'm an open book... six years ago, I couldn't even say the words periods without flushing red,\" she said. Natalie Jones, from Cardiff, has endometriosis andadenomyosis, and is currently waiting for her fourth surgery. The 35-year-old, who was diagnosed in 2018, has recently started to date again after a period of ill-health. The PhD student described herself as naturally a \"spontaneous person\" but said often she is so exhausted she fears cancelling dates may give the wrong impression - that she's unreliable or worse, uninterested. \"If you're just exhausted sometimes and you have to cancel plans especially in a new relationship, that might sound like you're just putting somebody off, or you're unreliable or you're messing someone around.\" The academic researcher said it can be particularly complicated when it comes to sex with the extra worry of heavy bleeding or pain. \"You don't want to set that expectation that intimacy is going to happen by having that discussion too early on but then if one thing leads to another, when do you bring it up, do you stop midway and say, 'oh by the way',\" she said. The keen traveller and gym-goer said that while it can be difficult watching friends start to settle down, she doesn't let it affect her. \"This is something that I can't control, but that doesn't take away from who I am and so if I'm dating or speaking with somebody who isn't prepared to either learn or understand... then that's probably not the right person anyway,\" she added. Pelvic health physiotherapist Pauline-Clare Callaghan said while there has been progress in recent years regarding open discussions around menstrual health and menopause, there's still much more to be done especially in endometriosis-related sexual pain. The healthcare professional, who has a special interest in endometriosis, said sexual pain with the condition can be complicated and may relate to the location of scar tissue, adhesions and fibrosis, or pelvic floor muscle being overactive, tight or inflamed. \"There are effective conservative treatments including pelvic physio but there is a care gap, there are many barriers to addressing sexual pain in endometriosis, including lack of awareness/understanding of support available, shame, embarrassment, cultural issues, and care access issues,\" she said. Faye Farthing fromEndometriosis UKsaid the condition can have a \"huge impact\" on people's sex lives and relationships. \"Sex can be a challenging topic to discuss with partners, especially if you're in a new relationship, which is why it's vital societal conversations continue around sex and endometriosis to break down the stigma,\" she said."}

Steve Clarke's squad wrote themselves into national folklore with a 4-2 win over Denmark. Goals from Scott McTominay, Lawrence Shankland, Kieran Tierney and Kenny McLean in a rollercoaster of a game mean the Tartan Army will be on the march to Canada, Mexico and the US next summer. Travel experts advised fans to start looking at the potential routes to North America now, more than two weeks before the draw for the competition is made. For those who were lucky enough to be inside Hampden for Tuesday night's match, it isa memory they will never forget. \"I was crying, I was weeping, I looked around at other people crying,\" Scotland fan Hamish Husband told BBC Radio Scotland's Lunchtime Live. His son, Elliott, added: \"I'm still struggling to comprehend it. \"My voice is gone since the fourth one went in. The stars really aligned, didn't they?\" Those able to tear themselves away from the highlights have alreadystarted planning their routesacross the Atlantic. There are 16 host cities spread over the three countries and the Tartan Army will not know exactly where they are heading until the group stage draw on 5 December. However, Simon Calder, travel correspondent for the Independent, said it might be worth booking in advance and navigating elsewhere from there. \"It's never too early to start planning travel to a big sporting event,\" he told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme. \"Sixteen days from now... all of this will be revealed at least at the group stages, at which point prices for flights and accommodation will go stratospheric. \"You could – and this is my strategy – take a guess on a transatlantic flight now.\" The last time Scotland played a World Cup match at France '98, the Scottish Parliament was yet to exist. Google had not been founded. Three of the players who started against Denmark - Aaron Hickey, Lewis Ferguson and Ben Gannon-Doak - were not born. Few of the Scotland fans who witnessed a 3-0 defeat by Morocco at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard in St Etienne on 23 June 1998 would have expected it would take 28 years for them to return to the sport's biggest stage. Darren Jackson, who played in that game, told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland: \"The resilience, the attitude, the desire and commitment of this squad is beyond belief. James Mcilkenny lived in Paris with his family during the '98 World Cup and still has memories of being on the Champs Elysees with the Tartan Army and Brazil fans the night before the opening game. \"Eleven-year-old me thought this would be a regular feature for Scotland,\" he told BBC Scotland News. \"Last night at Hampden was something that I don't think I'll every experience again. \"It was an emotional rollercoaster and after witnessing so many heartaches in the past, this felt so incredibly special.\" Politicians were united in paying tribute to Steve Clarke's team as the victory was celebrated in the Scottish Parliament. There have been calls for the Scotland manager to be knighted, for pubs to be given special late night licences, and for a holiday on the day of the opening match. Since 1978, Archie Gemmill's name has been a byword for a great Scotland goal. His mazy run and finish in the 3-2 win over the Netherlands in Argentina has long been lauded as one of the best ever scored in dark blue. Somewhat remarkably, Tuesday's game featuredthree more contenders for that crown. McTominay's overhead kick and Tierney's brilliantly-placed effort were already on the podium when McLean, despite the pleas of his manager to head for the corner, spotted Kasper Schmeichel off his line from inside his own half. That last-minute goal was enough to make BBC Scotland commentator Alistair Lamont lose his voice and sparked a celebration the national stadium had not seen for quite some time. John Collins, who scored 12 times in 52 Scotland caps, said: \"You'll never watch another game and seethree fantastic goals like that. \"If there was a World Cup given for spirit and determination we'd have it on the shelf just now.\" A total of 42 teams have qualified for the World Cup already. Six more will follow in a European and inter-confederation play-off scramble scheduled to take place in March. Four-time world champions Italy, regular qualifiers like Poland and Sweden and neighbours Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and Wales will all be involved in that. For Scotland though, this time,none of that matters."}

Mandatory age checks will be introduced for accounts using chat features, starting in December for Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands, then the rest of the globe from January. Roblox has faced criticism for allowing youngsters to access inappropriate content and communicate with adults, and is being sued over child safety concerns in several US states. The launch also comes just ahead ofAustralia's social media ban for under-16s- the government is under pressure to include gaming platforms such as Roblox. In March, the chief executive of Roblox, Dave Baszucki, said in aBBC interviewthat the company went to great lengths to keep children safe. However he also urged parents to be guided by their own instincts. \"My first message would be, if you're not comfortable, don't let your kids be on Roblox,\" he said. \"That sounds a little counter-intuitive, but I would always trust parents to make their own decisions.\" Rani Govender, policy manager for child safety online at the NSPCC, said action had been needed because young people had been exposed to \"unacceptable risks\" on Roblox, \"leaving many vulnerable to harm and online abuse.\" The charity welcomed the platform's latest announcement but called on Roblox to \"ensure they deliver change for children in practice and prevent adult perpetrators from targeting and manipulating young users.\" The platform averaged more than 80 million daily players in 2024, about 40% of them under the age of 13. The UK's Online Safety Act has strict laws for all tech firms specifically aimed at protecting children from online harms. The communications regulator, Ofcom, is responsible for enforcing the act. Anna Lucas, online safety supervision director at Ofcom, said she was pleased about the new age checking measures. \"Platforms must now take steps to keep kids safe, and we're ensuring they meet their responsibilities. There's more to do, but change is happening.\" In the US, Roblox is facing lawsuits in Texas, Kentucky and Louisiana over child safety concerns. Roblox says it will become the first large gaming platform to make facial age verification a requirement for accessing the chat features. Matt Kaufman, chief safety officer for Roblox, told a press briefing the age estimation technology is \"pretty accurate.\" He claimed the system can make close estimates of \"within one to two years\" bracket for users aged between five and 25. Currently it can be used voluntarily by anyone in the world. Users who complete the process will be placed into age groups: under nine, 9 to 12, 13 to 15, 16 to 17, 18 to 20 and 21+. Players can only chat with others in similar age ranges, unless they add someone as a \"trusted connection\", which is a feature for people they know. Under-13s will still be blocked from private messages and certain chats unless a parent gives permission. The new approach follows concerns about adults contacting younger players. In a BBC test earlier this year, it was possible for a 27-year-old user and a 15-year-old user on unlinked devices to exchange messages. At the time, Roblox said attempts to circumvent its rules often involved users trying to take conversations to different platforms. Age checks will use facial estimation technology through the device's camera inside the Roblox app, to estimate a user's age. Images are processed by an external provider and deleted immediately after the check has been completed, according to the company. Roblox says parents will still be able to manage their child's account, including updating a child's age once verification is complete. The platform already prohibits image and video sharing in chats and heavily restricts links to external sites. The company argues the new system will offer more \"age-appropriate\" experiences across the platform, and says it expects other firms to adopt similar methods. The changes come as campaign groups ParentsTogether Action and UltraViolet stage a first-of-its-kind virtual protest inside Roblox. The group will deliver a digital petition, which has been signed by more than 12,000 people, demanding the platform adopt stronger child-safety measures. It calls for sweeping changes, declaring, \"Roblox must stop being a playground for predators.\" Sign up for our Tech Decoded newsletterto follow the world's top tech stories and trends.Outside the UK?

There's a lot of passion involved.\" He had found it progressively harder to sleep, and to go into the office. Tony, who did not want his real name used, recallsthe Wannacry ransomware attackin 2017. \"It was a Friday and something came up on BBC News.\" The security team got on a call that evening and the decision was taken to remove every single device from the network. \"And it was Sunday afternoon that I came offline,\" he says. The firm hadn't been hit by the bug, he says. \"It was all preparatory work.\" Tony said this pattern is currently being repeated across organizations trying to protect themselves against theScattered Spider attacksthat hit retailers and other businesses this year. And, he says, \"I can't even imagine what the folks at Co-op and M&S have gone through.\" \"If you think you might be burning out, you're already on your way there,\" says Andrew Tillman, former head of cyber risk and assurance for the UK's Health Security Agency. He says cyber-security can, at times, be \"the best job in the world\". But when things get bad \"it can be a bit of a dangerous place to be\". Mr Tillman has suffered bouts of \"burnout\" himself through his four years at the agency. That stress is revealing itself in data collected by ISC2, the membership organisation for cyber-security professionals. Itsannual Workforce Studyshowed a 66% favourable job satisfaction rate in 2024, down four percentage points from the previous year. Burnout is a \"major issue\" for the sector, ISC2's chief information security officer Jon France says. He says professionals in the industry are increasingly being asked \"to do more with less\" which only increases stress and job dissatisfaction. \"Cyber-professionals rarely work nine to five\", he adds, \"Even if they do, they remain on call because threat actors don't adhere to office hours.\" Part of the issue is that hackers have become more aggressive, prepared to target critical national infrastructure, or cripple health organizations with ransomware. Also, hackers backed by nation states are also accounting for more attacks, whether to carry out espionage, steal IP, spread misinformation, or cause disruption, or even seek financial gain on their own account. North Korean hackers, for examplehave become more activeand adept at using cybercrime. Earlier this year hackers, thought to be working for the North Korean regime,stole $1.5bn (£1.1bn) worthof digital tokens from crypto exchange ByBit. US officials estimate that half of North Korea's foreign currency acquisitioncomes from cyber theft. As private and public sector organizations have digitized more of their operations, the ramifications of a cyber-attack or data breach are more severe. Mr Tillman says: \"There's always that conscious thought about 'if it goes wrong, how could this impact the individuals on the street? How could it affect their jobs, their livelihoods?'.\" Staff turnover is particularly pronounced in entry level roles, says Lisa Ackerman, former deputy chief information security officer (CISO) at GSK, and CISO Council strategic lead at Cybermindz, a non-profit targeting burnout in cyber security. Constant alerts from warning systems might compound the problem, presenting professionals with a barrage of data they have to make sense of. This could be a particular issue for the younger professionals in frontline roles and security operations centres. But non-frontline roles are not immune, says Mr Tillman. Managing risk and ensuring organisations meet compliance and regulatory obligations canbe a challenge when other teams are desperate to get new applications or services live without considering all the security angles. Cybermindz founder Peter Coroneos says cybersecurity workers can be caught in a \"blame culture\" where their successes are \"low visibility\". This leaves them carrying \"a low level of dread\", he explains. For younger workers this can be damaging, as the human brain is still developing well into the 20s, Mr Coroneos says. \"So, if you are recruiting people whose brains are not fully formed and putting them in high-stress roles, then you are potentially setting them up for long-term problems in terms of their own cognitive and emotional wellbeing.\" Cybermindz offers a \"structured neural training regime\" which aims to get subjects back to a sense of psychological safety. \"If someone's having a panic attack, telling them to just calm down isn't actually going to work. You need to address neurochemistry,\" says Mr Coroneos. Ultimately, says Mrs Ackerman, \"We want to get to some kind of legislation for cyber teams like we have for air traffic controllers and doctors and pilots and people who are first responders. Which, in reality, cyber defenders are.\" In the meantime, it's down to organizations and workers to watch out for the signs of stress before they turn into something more ominous. Mr Tillman says he is now far more aware of the warning signs of impending burnout, which for him include changing sleep patterns or eating habits, taking less exercise or not walking the dog. \"It's almost like a cyber-breach,\" he explains. \"You should assume it's on its way and work towards not allowing it to happen.\""}

This included stocking up on 497,000 tonnes of salt - more than was used for the entirety of last winter - and preparing 240 gritters to undertake salt spreading and snow ploughing patrols of the trunk road network. So far, November has been considerably milder than previous years. The coldest night since March was recorded on Saturday when temperatures dropped to -7C in Tulloch Bridge in the Highlands. Typical overnight temperatures at this time of year range from 2C in Scotland to 5C in the south of England, but they rarely fell into single figures during the first week of November this year.

The 33-year-old Norwich midfielder is wheeling his way to the corner flag with almost every member of the squad hunting him down. Ben Gannon-Doak, who was taken off on a stretcher in the first half of this utterly incredible 4-2 victory over Denmark, is like a Jack Russell welcoming its owner home from a week abroad. Fireworks are igniting out of the Hampden roof as Scott McTominay lies in a heap. About two hours earlier, his outrageous overhead kick had grown adults crying, hugging and bouncing about like toddlers. And that was only in the media seats. Goalkeeper Craig Gordon, 43 next month, has his head in his gloves in disbelief as the Hampden DJ hits play on Freed From Desire. Bodies are still flying about Hampden like empty tracksuits. Steve Clarke is one of them. A generation of Scotland fans have just witnessed the greatest game of their lives. The old guard might say the same after that. Scotland are going to first men's World Cup in 28 years 'I couldn't get Jota out my head' - what Scotland's heroes said How Scotland's bizarre but glorious campaign unfolded There's been a sense this night of all nights was written in the stars, given the way Scotland's bizarre qualifying campaign played out. Lady Luck has been mentioned, but there was nothing flukey about McTominay leaping the height of the Finnieston Crane to score an outrageous bicycle kick. There was no fortune in Scotland responding not once, but twice when it looked like the national team were going to find a new way to break five million hearts against the 10 men of Denmark. One fan said pre-match it felt like Scotland had cashed in almost 30 years' worth of glorious failure. Another supporter said Clarke and his players must have sold their souls for this opportunity. If that's what it takes to witness an occasion like this, the Tartan Army might be happy to wait another three decades for the next one. The thought of Andy Robertson and John McGinn dragging their bags of Scotland misfortune up to the football gods in exchange for a World Cup appearance is quite the image. After all, there is every chance this is their last go at this. Two absolute titans of this Scotland side, Robertson and McGinn, both 31, were the life and soul of the post-match celebrations. The emotion bursting out of the two of them hit like Kieran Tierney's stunner, or the brief ecstasy after Lawrence Shankland's poacher's finish. Boy do they deserve this. And that is before you even try to make sense of the emotional Hokey Cokey in the stands. Bedlam to anxiety. Anxiety to heartache. Heartache to bedlam. Bedlam to heartache. Heartache to bedlam. Bedlam to disbelief. Thompson and McFadden go wild for late Scotland goals Pre-match, nobody in the ground could have said they weren't ready to run on that pitch and do the job themselves when one of Hampden's great renditions of Flower of Scotland followed a pyro show. Three minutes after the first whistle, McTominay was sprinting to the home dugout after the goal of his career. There the Napoli midfielder stood, all alone, blowing a kiss up to his loved ones. The kids apparently call it 'aura'. \"You've just witnessed the goal of the season,\" screamed the PA announcer. A generation of Scotland fans had just witnessed the goal of their life. Well, they thought they had. Tierney's curler and McLean's astonishing moment will also qualify. When the party moved to elsewhere and the Hampden stands were eventually empty, there was veteran keeper Gordon, drafted back in for this camp, standing on the pitch getting pictured with his family. A good chunk of this squad weren't born the last time Scotland played on the grandest stage. The rest were probably still in nappies. Gordon, a teenager at the time, will remember his dreams. Next summer, he and his team-mates get to live them with the nation. 'I woke up this morning with no nerves'"}

A new law is imminent on owning devices used in car thefts, some of which allow thieves to bounce the signal from a key inside a property to open a car. But experts say the ban is unlikely to stop gangs who are loaning them out for large sums and stealing vehicles to order. The BBC has seen price lists and video guides for devices claiming to access cars including Lamborghinis and Maseratis, with gadgets selling for up to €25,000 (£22,000). Abbie Brookes-Morris said criminals used a device to steal her keyless vehicle, a theft she calls \"an invasion\". She said the car, which she shares with her partner Tom, was stolen from outside their home in Wolverhampton while they slept. \"Although they didn't physically come into the house, you don't feel safe,\" she said. Her doorbell camera captured footage of a gang using a gadget outside her property. \"They're walking back and forwards trying to find the signal. I didn't know that thing existed, I had no idea,\" she said. \"It took them two minutes in total to arrive, look at the car, get the signal and leave.\" Abbie said police later found their car abandoned some distance away, but it is now unusable and has been immobilised due to the way the theft was carried out. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) data on police recorded crime from the Home Office, more than 100,000 vehicles were stolen within the last 12 months. Admiral Insurance told the BBC its figures suggest between 60% and 70% of vehicle thefts in the past year were keyless models. However, it does not have data for the number stolen using these devices. The BBC found some gadgets are disguised as Bluetooth speakers, used to target lower value cars, while others are military grade technology which can block the signal of a car tracker so it cannot be traced once stolen. Richard Billyeald, from Thatcham Research which works with the car industry to improve security, said: \"You're really only using these if you're stealing cars, there's no legitimate use in any other way at all. \"What we've seen is this move from the opportunistic theft of cars to organised criminal gangs stealing cars to order to really make money, and that's why they're investing so much money in these devices.\" The crime is difficult for police to combat because the gadgets are being passed around the country by organised crime groups, said Neil Thomas, a car tracking expert who helps retrieve stolen vehicles. \"They'll just loan the devices out,\" he said. \"Criminals are paying huge sums, but they'll make those sums back. They're potentially stealing 10 cars a week. This is very much organised cross-border crime.\" While keyless entry is a convenience for drivers returning to their cars with their hands full of shopping or carrying children, they become \"a nightmare if your street is targeted by relay theft,\" said Jack Cousens from the AA. \"The days of smash and grab are diminishing. As vehicles become more technologically advanced, would-be thieves do their best to stay ahead of the game. That's why we've seen a rise in relay theft across the country,\" he said. Under new laws in the Crime and Policing Bill, which is making its way through Parliament, it will be illegal to possess or share electronic devices used to steal cars and could lead to up to five years in prison. Previously, police could only prosecute if they proved the equipment was used to commit a specific crime."}

Many aspects of their arrival remain unclear and disputed. The flight was part of \"a clear agenda to cleanse Palestinians out of Gaza and the West Bank\", Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola said on Monday. The Israeli authorities have not responded to this allegation. However, they said that South Africa had previously agreed to receive the 153 Palestinians. The BBC has asked the South African authorities to comment. The Palestinian embassy in South Africa has said the group left Israel's Ramon Airport and flew to the country via the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, \"without any prior note or coordination\". It said that \"an unregistered and misleading organization\" had exploited the plight of the Gaza citizens, \"deceived families, collected money from them, and facilitated their travel in an irregular and irresponsible manner\". The Palestinian foreign ministry went on to say, through the embassy, that it was working with South Africa to \"address this situation resulting from this lapse\". The flight at the centre of the dispute arrived on Thursday, at South Africa's OR Tambo International Airport. The passengers were initially refused entry into the country and were stuck on the plane for more than 10 hours. Authorities in South Africa, which has strongly supported the Palestinian cause during the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas, said this was because the passengers did not have departure stamps in their passports. Palestinians are allowed to travel to South Africa for 90 days without a visa. Eventually, the group was allowed to disembark after intervention from a local charity. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said this was out of \"empathy [and] compassion\". Twenty-three of the passengers had already taken flights elsewhere so 130 were allowed into the country, South African authorities said. During a media briefing about South Africa's readiness to host the G20 Leaders' Summit, taking place this weekend, Lamola said Thursday's flight looked like it was part of a \"broader agenda to remove Palestinians from Palestine into many different parts of the world\". \"[This] is a clearly orchestrated operation because they are not only being sent to South Africa. There are other countries where such flights have been sent,\" he said, without giving any details. He added that the matter was being investigated. Two weeks ago, another plane carrying 176 Palestinians landed in Johannesburg, with some of the passengers proceeding to other countries, according to the local Gift of the Givers charity that is assisting the arrivals. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly spoken about resettling Palestinians from Gaza \"voluntarily\" - a move that has been criticised by Palestinians, human rights groups and many in the international community. Speaking a day after the flight arrived, South Africa's president said the Palestinians \"somehow mysteriously were put on a plane that passed by Nairobi\" and flew to South Africa, according to local online publication News24. Israeli military body Cogat, which controls Gaza's crossings, said in a statement: \"The residents left the Gaza Strip after Cogat received approval from a third country to receive them.\" It did not specify the country at the time. Cogat on Monday named South Africa as the third country that had agreed to receive the Palestinians. South Africa has been highly critical of Israel's military operation in Gaza. The country's sympathy for the Palestinian fight for an independent state goes back decades, particularly the early 1990s when anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela pledged support for the Palestinian cause. Large pro-Palestinian marches have been held around South Africa since the conflict began. Smaller pro-Israel marches and rallies have been held in the country, which hosts the largest Jewish community in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2023, the South African government filed a case against Israel with the International Court of Justice, accusing it of genocide in Gaza. Israel has strongly rejected the South African claim, calling it \"baseless\". Go toBBCAfrica.comfor more news from the African continent.

In a unanimous judgement the UK's highest court allowed an appeal by an unnamed father and daughter from Northern Ireland. In 2022, the High Court in Belfast ruledthat the Christian-based RE taught at primary schools in Northern Ireland was unlawful. However, the Department of Education (DE) subsequently won an appeal against that judgement. But on Wednesday the Supreme Court unanimously allowed the father and daughter's subsequent appeal and dismissed the Department's cross-appeal. A spokesperson for The Department of Education said: \"We will carefully consider the complex judgement and its implications and will provide advice to schools in the near future.\" The father and daughter challenged the legality of the teaching of RE and the practice of collective worship in the primary school which she attended between the ages of four and seven. The proceedings involved points of law which affected those involved in this case as well as the teaching of RE and the practice of collective worship more generally in Northern Ireland. The Supreme Court heard that withdrawing the 11-year-old girl from RE and worship would have left her \"stigmatised\" – because, for example, she would have been the only pupil in her class not to take part. These factors led the court to rule that the right to withdrawal placed an \"undue burden\" on parents. The Supreme Court backed the original High Court judgement from 2022 which held that as both RE and collective worship in the school followed the core syllabus specified by the DE - they were not conveyed in \"an objective, critical, and pluralistic manner\". The court said the judgement \"was not about secularism in the education system\" and made clear that \"no one is suggesting that RE should not be provided in schools in Northern Ireland\". The court said: \"The family strongly support the provision of religious education provided it does not amount to indoctrination.\" The legal action was taken by a father and his daughter who attended a Belfast primary school. The family took the case anonymously. In a state-controlled school, the girl received non-denominational Christian religious education and took part in Christian worship. However, her parents did not wish her to be taught that Christianity was an absolute truth. In 2019, they wrote to the school voicing concerns that it did not conform with their own beliefs. The family asked if inspection mechanisms were in place to ensure that pupils were receiving a balanced religious education. The school replied that its religious education was \"Bible-based\" and followed the core syllabus for education. The family argued that their rights, which requires the State providing education to \"respect the right of parents to ensure such education is in conformity with their own religious and philosophical convictions\", had been contravened. Darragh Mackin from Phoenix Law who acted on behalf of the father and daughter, said the decision was \"a watershed moment for educational rights in this jurisdiction\". \"The judgement makes clear that the state cannot rely on withdrawal mechanisms to justify religious instruction.\" Mr Mackin continued: \"Schools must not place children in the impossible position of being singled out or stigmatised simply because their families do not share the religious worldview embedded in the curriculum.\" Speaking to the BBC's Evening Extra programme, he said it \"is probably the single most important legal decision for education certainly in the last century.\" Bishop Donal McKeown told BBC News NI he is \"quite sanguine\" about the ruling, and its implications. \"I think it's not unsurprising at this stage in our history,\" he said. \"Northern Ireland has changed a lot since the last core curriculum was put together and I think it is certainly a time for a revision of what we teach and how we teach as the core curriculum. So in that sense, I'm quite sanguine about the whole thing.\" Bishop McKeown said \"there are questions to be asked\", adding he is positive about \"the need for a new RE core curriculum\" and is \"quite open\" to seeing where this goes. \"I'm looking forward to the next stage of the journey, I don't see it as a negative thing. There are many points to be clarified - this is an opportunity for all of us to be involved in renewing the RE curriculum to enable us to create a healthy, forward-looking society.\" Reverend Andrew Forster, the Bishop of Derry and Raphoe and Chair of the Transferor Representatives' Council (TRC) said the TRC noted the judgement and \"will take some time to consider the ruling\". \"The judgement brings a long court process to a conclusion and once the ruling is considered, we hope it will provide clarity and direction in respect of both the teaching of religious education and collective worship in schools.\" There has also been reaction to the ruling from political parties. Green party councillor Anthony Flynn congratulated the family and said the ruling \"is hugely significant, and can't be ignored by the [Northern Ireland] Executive.\" \"No child in a publicly-funded school should be pushed into a religious worldview that isn't theirs. Northern Ireland is changing, our communities are diverse, and our education system needs to reflect that.\" Flynn said RE \"should be balanced, inclusive and modern\" and that this \"is a chance to finally update NI's education framework so every child feels welcome and respected\". \"It's 2025. Our schools should represent everyone,\" he added. Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MP Carla Lockhart said the Supreme Court ruling was \"bitterly disappointing\" and \"very concerning\". \"I obviously don't want to force religion down anyone's throat, but we do have protection in Northern Ireland\" for parental choice, she told theBBC's Evening Extra programme, adding that parents \"can remove your children from such lessons\". She said the ruling will have \"ramifications\" for education in Northern Ireland, but that her party \"will not be deterred from promoting and preserving Christian values and teaching in schools\". Alliance Party assembly member Nick Mathison who chairs Stormont's education committee, said \"this is not about stopping the teaching of RE\". \"This is about making sure that the religious education delivered in schools is critical, objective and pluralistic. \"We live in a diverse community,\" he said, adding: \"This is just about making sure our schools are inclusive spaces.\" He said there should be \"space\" for Christian collective worship, as well as \"space for other approaches and other views\". In a post on social media, David Smyth, from the Evangelical Alliance Northern Ireland, said: \"While we acknowledge there will be many questions and concerns from Christian parents and those involved in education, this is not a moment for fear. \"There is an opportunity here to re-imagine how we engage with education, teach and share Christianity with young people in new and fresh ways.\" Holly, who spoke to BBC News NI from Derry city centre, said: \"I think it should be an option whether or not you're even taught religion in school. \"It shouldn't be forced upon you. It'll be interesting now to see what changes are made to religious education here after today's ruling.\" Carl Anderson, from Dungiven said: \"I think young people should be taught whatever religious background their parents and grandparents come from. \"Religion is important to everyone – colour or creed. Respect is easy carried and we should be able to live beside each other side by side.\" By Robbie Meredith, Education and arts correspondent, BBC News NI: This started with the experience of one family and has led to what is a very, very significant judgement. The child went to primary school and her parents noticed that when the child was coming home and eating, she was saying her prayers before meals. They were a non-religious family - they didn't have any strong religious beliefs - and they asked: \"Why?\" The child basically said this is what she had been taught to do in school. It is important to be clear that the Supreme Court ruling is not going to mean that the teaching of RE in schools will end, or that there will be no more hymns or prayers in school assemblies. But it does mean that some things are likely to change. The judges said that was \"a complete absence of plurality in relation to the teachings or practices of any other religions or non-religious traditions and philosophies,\" especially in primary schools. So in future children are likely to be taught about a range of religions in RE, not just Christianity, from the earliest years of primary school. Schools may also have to think about inviting a wider range of speakers to school assemblies, not just Christian ministers or organisations."}

The new photos - the latest of which was taken on 8 November - show that entire neighbourhoods controlled by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have been levelled in less than a month, apparently through demolitions. The actual number of destroyed buildings could be significantly higher, with satellite imagery for some areas being unavailable for BBC Verify's assessment. Some experts have argued that the demolitions may violate the terms of the ceasefire brokered by the US, Egypt, Qatar and Turkey. But an IDF spokesperson told BBC Verify that it was acting \"in accordance with the ceasefire framework\". US President Donald Trump's 20 point peace plan for Gaza - the basis for the ceasefire - stated \"all military operations, including aerial and artillery bombardment, will be suspended\". He has since repeatedlystated that \"the war is over\". BBC Verify's visual analysis of satellite imagery has found that the destruction of buildings in Gaza by the Israeli military has been continuing on a huge scale. We used a change detection algorithm to analyse radar images taken before and after the ceasefire to highlight changes, which might indicate destruction, then manually counted visibly destroyed buildings. We looked at buildings destroyed behind the Yellow Line - a boundary running along the north, south and east of Gaza. Under October's ceasefire deal Israel agreed to withdraw its forces to that marker, annotated by a yellow line on maps released by the IDF. Many of the razed buildings did not appear to be damaged prior to being destroyed, for example, in eastern Khan Younis, around Abasan al-Kabira. It's hard to be conclusive from a satellite image taken from above, but these buildings did not have visible damage to their structure or tell tale signs like nearby rubble or changes to their outlines. There were houses with gardens, trees and some small orchards. A comparison between satellite images of this area captured at the start of the war in October 2023 with images captured around the date of the ceasefire shows little change to many buildings. Lana Khalil used to live in Abasan al-Kabira before she was displaced to nearby al-Mawasi. She described her home as being a \"heaven\" and full of \"farms and vegetables\". Now, like so many other parts of Gaza, the area has been reduced to rubble. \"The Israeli military left nothing to us, they demolished everything,\" she said. Ms Khalil added that former residents could hear the demolition of the area \"from our tents in al-Mawasi\". \"Our hearts are broken,\" she said. In another area, near al-Bayuk, east of the city of Rafah, satellite imagery tells the same story. Numerous buildings that seemed from above to be undamaged before the ceasefire have since been destroyed. Aerial footage of a huge explosion published at the start of November shows dust rising from the ruins of the neighbourhood. Destruction has also continued in Gaza City itself, in the eastern neighbourhood of Shejaiya as well as near the Indonesian hospital on the edge of Jabalia camp. Eitan Shamir, ex-head of the National Security Doctrine Department in the Israel Ministry of Strategic Affairs, suggested that the IDF's actions were not a violation of the ceasefire terms, arguing that they don't apply to areas of the Strip behind the Yellow Line. Verified videos showing controlled demolitions and excavators tearing down buildings published to social media since the ceasefire have also been geolocated to areas behind the Yellow Line. The IDF has defended its actions and a spokesperson said: \"According to the agreement, all terror infrastructure, including tunnels, is to be dismantled throughout Gaza. Israel is acting in response to threats, violations, and terror infrastructure.\" On 18 October, Israel's Defence Minister Israel Katz wrote on X that \"demilitarizing Gaza by destroying the terror tunnels and all terror infrastructure\" was a \"clear\" part of Israel's security policy. Point 13 of Trump's peace plan published by the White House - the closest thing to publicly released terms of the ceasefire - stated that all \"military, terror, and offensive infrastructure, including tunnels and weapon production facilities, will be destroyed and not rebuilt\". But it also states the process of demilitarisation of Gaza will be \"under the supervision of independent monitors\". \"This is definitely a violation of the ceasefire,\" said Dr H A Hellyer, a RUSI Senior Associate Fellow. \"But [Washington] DC is unwilling to recognise it as such, insisting that the ceasefire has to hold, even when it isn't actually holding.\" But Mr Shamir denied the IDF was breaching the ceasefire. He told BBC Verify that according to his sources within the IDF there was a view that: \"Hamas is allowed to do what it wants in the territory it controls, and Israel is allowed to do what it wants in the territory it controls.\" The IDF was taking the view that it was unlikely Hamas would follow through with the second stage of the agreement, according to his sources. \"Therefore, the space must be prepared for the continuation of the fighting, so as not to leave [them] any options to ambush our soldiers.\" He also said that there were frequent attempts by Hamas to infiltrate beyond the Yellow Line and that there were still long sections of tunnel to be dealt with. Some analysts - such as Adil Haque, professor of law at Rutgers University - said Israel could be violating the laws of war, which prohibit the destruction of civilian property by an occupying power. He noted that exceptions to the rule can only arise \"from military operations, that is, from combat or direct preparations for combat,\" arguing that during a ceasefire \"it is not plausible that such significant destruction of civilian property has been rendered absolutely necessary by military operations\". Hugh Lovatt, Senior Policy Fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said ultimately the demolitions could jeopardise the peace plan. \"The problem of Israeli demolitions will grow the longer Israel stays in the zone behind the Yellow Line. \"Ultimately, the sense that Israel is stalling its withdrawal and looking to create new permanent facts on the ground, as it has in the West Bank, will become an increasingly greater threat to the maintenance of the ceasefire.\" Additional reporting by Alex Murray.

Simon Whelband is a Conservative councillor and also works for the Conservative MP Neil O'Brien, who wassanctioned by China in 2021. Simon went into his LinkedIn messages and there it was. A message from an account in the name of Shirly Shen sent some weeks earlier. He hadn't responded to the unsolicited message and reported it to Parliament's security services. He was then advised to block the account. The note comes across as pretty innocuous. He said: \"The message wasn't written in very good English, it was a message to say there was a job opportunity and was I interested, and to get in touch if I was. \"I've worked around Parliament for about 10 years now so I'm kind of used to this. \"But if you were more junior, you don't know what you're looking for. \"You might think it's a genuine offer that's made to you on LinkedIn, they might accept.\" Whelband added that he thought it was becoming more common for those working in Parliament to be targeted by China. \"They have realised the way to get to Parliamentarians is through their staff... it's deeply worrying,\" he said. And so, for the second time this autumn, Westminster is collectively wrestling with what to do about China. The growing influence of this vast superpower is one of the two stand out global changes of the last 30 years, alongside the growth of the internet. Some of the most acute challenges - or threats - from Beijing come when both of these mega-trends of the early 21st Century combine. Senior figures in government are worried, but express their worry carefully in public. MPs outside of government are much more willing to be blunt. Tuesday's debate in the Commons on this was an eye opener. The security minister Dan Jarvis was both circumspect in his language, but warm and accepting of the wide range of concerns expressed by MPs of multiple parties. Last month, Parliament was digesting the collapse of a court case involving two men accused of spying for China, one of whom had worked in Westminster.Both men always denied any wrongdoing. Now it is the warning that all MPs and members of the House of Lordshave received from the security service MI5that they might be Beijing's next target. It says it has identified two LinkedIn profiles used by Chinese security services to act as \"civilian recruitment headhunters\", targeting individuals working in British politics to solicit \"insider insights\". Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle and his counterpart in the House of Lords, Lord McFall, circulated the warning to MPs and peers on Tuesday. The alert specifically identified two LinkedIn profiles set up with the names Amanda Qiu and Shirly Shen. The BBC has contacted both for a response, although it is not clear if the women named and pictured on the networking site are the actual account holders. As Jarvis put it, China \"has a low threshold for information it regards as valuable\". This is because over time it builds up a wider picture by piecing together the morsels it may extract from a wide range of people. Labour, since they won the general election, have attempted to warm up the UK's relationship with China. The Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has been to Beijing, as has the Business Secretary, Peter Kyle, who was there in September within days of being appointed to the role. The most senior civil servant in the Foreign Office, Sir Olly Robbins, was there last month in the midst of all those headlines about the collapsed spying trial. But there has long been a vociferous collection of China hawks in Parliament, who have long worried about what they see as a collective naivety about Beijing. The question now is whether a moment like this, following MI5's intervention, persuades others to share their outlook. The government insists its approach to China is \"pragmatic\": it regards working with Beijing as inevitable but insists it is \"clear eyed\" about the risks. Will a growing number of MPs demand a more sceptical outlook? As one put it, rather colourfully, \"you can't reason with a tiger when your head is in its mouth\". China is a vast superpower that is at once essential yet awkward, unavoidable yet dangerous. This the latest case study in those competing interests. There will be more to come."}

Johnson Wen, 26, was found guilty of being a public nuisance overthe high-profile incidentlast Thursday at the Asia premiere for Wicked: For Good. Videos posted on social media show Wen jumping the barriers, charging at a visibly shocked Grande and grabbing her shoulders while jumping up and down. The incident sparked outrage in Singapore, where many called for the arrest and deportation of Wen, who has a history of disrupting concerts and celebrity events. Several accused him of \"re-traumatising\" Grande. The pop star turned actress has spoken of experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder after a suicide bomb attack at her May 2017 concert in Manchester, killing 22 people and injuring hundreds. In Wen's trial on Monday, the court heard he had attempted to intrude on the movie premiere twice, Singaporean media reports. Moments after he grabbed Grande, her co-star Cynthia Erivo forcibly pried him off and security staff escorted him out. He then made a second attempt to jump the barricades. Security staff stopped him and this time pinned him down. Wen later posted videos of the incident on his social media accounts thanking Grande and stating that he was \"free\". Police in Singapore arrested him the next day and charged him with public nuisance. Wen pleaded guilty. Prosecutors sought a week's jail for Wen, arguing that he was a \"serial intruder\" who publicised his behaviour to gain popularity online. Wen has posted videos of himself disrupting concerts by Katy Perry and The Weeknd, and invading the pitch at various sporting events. Australian media have reported he is banned from some stadiums and has incurred large fines. Wen, who was not represented in the Singapore court, told the judge in mitigation that he would \"not do it again\". Under Singapore's laws against public nuisance, Wen could have been jailed for up to three months, fined up to S$2,000 (£1,167; $1,537), or both. Grande has not commented on the case, while continuing to appear in public at events in Los Angeles over the weekend. But two days after the incident, Erivo appeared to allude to it when she spoke about her relationship with Grande while making the movie, saying: \"We have come through some stuff in our lives, our daily workings... even this last week, let's be honest.\""}

Exports to India's largest foreign market had dropped sharply last month after 50% US tariffs on India - including a 25% penalty for buying Russian oil - kicked in on 27 August. The improved data came as Indian state-run oil firms agreed toimportmore annual liquified petroleum gas (LPG) from the US and Trump exempted manyfarm goodsfrom reciprocal tariffs that could benefit India. Trade deal negotiations between the two countries are under way, with an Indianofficialsaying that key aspects of the deal were nearing closure. The jump in exports to the US came even as India's overall goods exports fell 11.8% year-on-year in October, with 15 of its top 20 markets seeing a decline in bilateral trade. \"Tariff-exempt sectors such as smartphones and pharmaceuticals may have performed better - though this remains a tentative assumption,\" said Ajay Srivastava of Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), a Delhi-based think tank, commenting on the latest trade numbers. \"Despite the October rebound, India's shipments to the US have dropped nearly 28.4% between May and October, erasing more than $2.5bn in monthly export value,\" Mr Srivastava added. But trade tensions between the two countries appear to be gradually letting up after months of uncertainty. On Monday, India said it had concluded a first-ever major deal that will see its state-run oil companies sourcing some 10% of the country's annual LPG needs from the US. Petroleum Minister Hardeep Singh Puri described the decision as a \"historic development\" and said the world's largest and fastest growing LPG market has now opened up to the United States. The Trump administration has been urging Delhi to ramp up its purchase of US petroleum products and reduce its dependency on Russian oil. India became one of the biggest markets for Russian oil as Western nations imposed sanctions on Moscow after the Ukraine war started in 2022. Last year, India bought $52.7bn of Russian crude -37% of its oil bill- but Trump has reiterated time and again, that the country has agreed to reduce its purchases, something India has not officially confirmed. Delhi is walking a diplomatic tightrope on energy imports as Russian President Vladimir Putin prepares to visit Delhi early next month to finalise several agreements and projects, local reports say. Yet trade talks between India and the US - stalled for months over Delhi's refusal to cut Russian oil imports - now appear to be moving quickly despite this. On Monday, a senior government official told The Hindu newspaper that thefirst phase of the trade dealis \"more or less near closure\". India is also set to benefit from the US's decision to roll back reciprocal tariffs on certain agricultural products such as tea, coffee and spices - a move that,analysts say, would effectively exempt about $1bn worth of India's agricultural exports to the US from duties.

As a sign of his devotion, Gui Junmin decided to freeze his wife Zhan Wenlian's body after she died from lung cancer in 2017, aged 49, making her China's first cryogenically preserved person. But after a November interview revealed he had been dating a different partner since 2020, Chinese social media has been torn on Mr Gui's predicament. Whilst some asked why the 57-year-old didn't just \"let go\" another commenter remarked he appeared to be \"most devoted to himself\". After Zhan Wenlian was given months to live by doctors, Gui Junmin decided to use cryonics - which is scientifically unproven - to preserve her body once she died. Following her death, he signed a 30-year agreement to preserve his wife's frozen body with theShandong Yinfeng Life Science Research Institute. Since then, Zhan's body has been stored in a 2,000-litre container at the institute in a vat of -190C liquid nitrogen. Chinese newspaper Southern Weekly revealed that although Mr Gui lived alone for two years after the procedure, in 2020 he began dating again, despite his wife remaining in cryopreservation. He told the newspaper that a severe gout attack which left him unable to move for two days began to change his mind about the benefits of living alone. Soon after, he started seeing his current partner Wang Chunxia, although Mr Gui suggested to the paper the love was only \"utilitarian\" and that she hadn't \"entered\" his heart. Reacting to the news, some commentators on the Chinese social media site Weibo showed sympathy with Mr Gui's plight, highlighting how long it had been since his wife was put in the cryogenic chamber. Some believed it was time for him to move on from his frozen former spouse, adding he should, \"let the departed...rest in peace\". But others suggested the he had acted selfishly to only \"satisfy his emotional needs\", with one post questioning \"Would Zhan agree to this? Is it fair to Wang?\". Cryonics is where the whole body is cooled down to sub-zero temperatures, infused with cryoprotectants - which is similar to antifreeze - to prevent ice crystal formation, then preserved in liquid nitrogen. The hope is that the body can one day be revived when future technology makes this possible. The practice is currently used at a smaller scale in day-to-day medicine, where living cells such as blood cells, sperm and embryos are frozen at ultra-low temperatures to be stored. It's estimated that over 500 people have been cryogenically preserved worldwide, the majority of them in the US. No one has ever been successfully revived following cryopreservation, and scientists believe that preserving and reawakening the complete human body is still a remote possibility.

Here's how to fix it", "body": "We all know our phones aren't great for our relationships, but that doesn't stop us reaching for them dozens of times a day. That's how so called phubbing - unintentionally snubbing someone in favour of your phone - creeps into everyday moments. This can impact your relationship by making partners feel ignored and parental phone use can really affect children from weakening bonds with younger kids and denting self-esteem in older ones. Rather than criticising yourself about your lack of self-control, focusing on being more intentional about when we pick up our devices can be more effective, according to one psychologist. Dr Kaitlyn Regehr, Associate Professor at University College London suggests one simple way to stop you picking up your phone mindlessly when you're with someone else. Every time you reach for your phone, tell the other person why you're doing it, and when you're done, put it down and re-engage. It sounds almost too easy, but Dr Regehrtells Woman's Hourthat this small shift can help change our behaviour as we often check messages, swipe notifications or \"Just quickly look something up\" without thinking. What matters is being transparent, so if a message pops up that you need to check, you should tell the person or people you are with: \"I just need to reply to this, then you'll have my attention again.\" By naming it - \"I need to check my train times\" or \"I'm replying to my mum\" - you interrupt the automatic habit of checking your phone and it also signals to the person beside you that they still matter. \"It stops the other person feeling ignored,\" Dr Regehr says. \"And it keeps you accountable, because you're less likely to drift into other apps or endless scrolling.\" Doing this could help improve your relationships too. Dr Claire Hart, Associate Professor of Psychology at the University of Southampton,led a studywhich involved speaking to 196 people about their relationships and phone use. Overall the results showed that the more you feel you're being phubbed, the worse your relationship tends to be. \"Not everyone reacts in the same way,\" Dr Hart says. \"It depends on personality, but once one person feels ignored, it can trigger retaliation. \"They pick up their own phone, and that's when it becomes a dangerous spiral as each partner feels rejected or less valued than whatever's on the screen.\" Every time you are phubbed you lose connection and once you've left a shared moment to look at a screen, it can take a while to get back to what was going on before."}

Terrence and Lesley Bridges have seen their energy bills drop dramatically, from £375 a month down to as low as £40, since they swapped their gas boiler for a HeatHub – a small data centre containing more than 500 computers. Data centres are banks of computers which carry out digital tasks. As the computers process data, they generate lots of heat, which is captured by oil and then transferred into the Bridges' hot water system. Mr Bridges, 76, says keeping his two-bed bungalow near Braintree warm was a necessity as his wife has spinal stenosis and is in \"a lot of pain\" when it gets colder. \"It truly is brilliant,\" Mr Bridges continues. \"I'm over the moon that we got picked to trial this out. You can't fault the heating system – it is a 100% improvement on what we had before.\" \"You don't need to go to a sauna after coming here,\" Mrs Bridges, 75, adds. The HeatHub was developed by Thermify and is part of UK Power Networks'SHIELD project, which aims to come up with innovative ways for low-income households to transition to net zero. Through SHIELD, the Bridges also had solar panels and a battery put in, which have contributed to their savings. Mr Bridges, a retired RAF sergeant, says despite putting \"the heating up fairly high to keep it nice and warm\", his bill has fallen to between £40 and £60 each month. \"I think it's fantastic because it's eco-friendly,\" he continues, \"we're not burning any gases, so it's green – it's environmentally friendly.\" Thermify co-founder and CEO Travis Theune says the Bridges' HeatHub will eventually be part of a \"remote and distributed\" data centre, involving many units processing data for customers. While not designed for the heavy processing needed for artificial intelligence, Mr Theune says the system could run things like apps or analyse large volumes of data. He says the company wanted to design a system to provide both \"clean\" and \"affordable\" energy because \"finding a way to do both was a hard problem\". The project is still in the pilot phase, but in the future, clients will pay Thermify to process their data using the HeatHubs. Mr Theune adds the system provides \"clean, green heat at a low-to-no price point\" because \"the electricity that's generating that heat is paid for by somebody else\". The Bridges' landlord, social housing provider Eastlight Community Homes, is also part of SHIELD. Daniel Greenwood, Eastlight's head of asset management, says he hopes the next phase of the project will see 50 homes get HeatHubs, and adds: \"We've seen great results for the current installation, and although this is the first of its kind, we're looking to roll that out more broadly.\" Jack McKellar, UK Power Networks’ innovation programme manager, says: \"We don't want anyone to miss out on the benefits of new and emerging technologies, as the UK moves towards a greener future.\" Data centres help run the modern world. It is estimated they consume about 2.5% of the UK's electricity, and as more are built, their power demand could rise fourfold by 2030. Thermify is not alone in trying to capture and use the heat generated by data centres. Aswimming pool in Devonis being warmed by a washing machine-sized \"digital boiler\". The company behind that scheme is also involved in a proposal to build theMelbourn Energy Superloop– a combined solar-powered data centre and district heat network in south Cambridgeshire. Milton Keynes University Hospitalwas also hopingto be the first place in the city to benefit from £95m plans to share heat from a new data centre. According to theInternational Energy Agency, data centres use up to 30% of their electricity consumption on cooling. Mike Richardson, the 66-year-old founder and owner of DSM, says he had tried to incorporate \"nature\" as much as possible into his data centre at a former RAF base just off the A1 near Peterborough. A 200kW array of solar panels helps power it, and a 500 cubic-metre artificial lake cools it down. The lake is filled with water collected from the roof of an old aircraft hangar and pumped from two boreholes. Four heat exchangers are submerged in the 1.7 metre deep water, which is also home to dozens of koi carp and tench – fish that have their own role in the operation. \"We need to keep the pipes clean, and they eat the algae,\" Mr Richardson tells the BBC. With a 400kW capacity, the data centre is relatively small – or \"boutique\", according to Mr Richardson. Warm water is pumped from data racks to heat exchangers in the lake, then the cooled water is sent back inside, in a closed loop. Traditional cooling systems often rely on compressing a chemical coolant, which can be toxic. \"Keeping away from chemicals is an important thing for us,\" Mr Richardson says. He adds that because there was no need for compression, the setup used much less electricity for cooling. \"Yes, it works – it most definitely works,\" Mr Richardson says.

But just a few kilometres from the spruced-up, highly secure venue is a city centre which the authorities are struggling to improve and keep safe. They face major challenges in cleaning up more than 100 derelict buildings, many plagued by rubbish and open sewage, some of which have been taken over by criminal gangs. \"There's guns, there's drugs, there's prostitutes, there's everything here,\" said Nelson Khetani, resident of a building known as MBV1, located in Joubert Park. Neglect and a lack of maintenance have left vandalised communal kitchens stripped of their fittings, while overflowing human waste covers parts of what used to be the laundry area. Mr Khetani told BBC Africa Eye that rooms in MBV1 had been hijacked – a phenomenon where spaces or entire residential units are taken over and controlled by criminals to collect rent for themselves and, in some circumstance, provide a base for illegal activities. The BBC has located and confirmed that there are 102 derelict or abandoned buildings in the inner city, an area of about 18 sq km (seven sq miles), but other media reports have cited much higher figures. Some of these have been hijacked and are unfit for human habitation. The state of the city was on the mind of President Cyril Ramaphosa when talking about the G20 summit to the city council in March. \"I found the city filthy,\" he said. \"It is a painful sight to go through the centre of the city… you have a number of abandoned buildings, buildings that have been hijacked, that are not paying your rates and taxes.\" Johannesburg Mayor Dada Morero said at the time that the city was \"ready to host the G20\". Last month, as part of a \"clean-up\" campaign across Johannesburg, the city council said the inner city had been \"targeted...  for the systemic removal of pervasive lawlessness, illegal activities, hijacked properties, and critical by-law infringements\". But the challenges ahead of the world event are huge. A fire at one of these derelict buildings that killed 76 people two years ago was supposed to spur people into action, but it seems not much has changed. The BBC visited another inner-city building, Vannin Court, where rooms were covered in dirt and strewn with litter. A strong smell of human faeces permeated the building. Resident Sinethemba Maqoma told the BBC that council-owned Vannin Court had been hijacked, and that the city council had cut off the water. \"The municipality was angry about the crime from this building... that's why they took [away] the water,\" said another resident, Sinqhiwe Goodman Sithole. Johannesburg's city council did not respond to the BBC's request for comment about Vannin Court's water supply. There is also no electricity supply, Mr Maqoma said, adding that they use gas and solar lights. The lack of utilities means residents cook food using portable gas tanks to power stoves. But without water or fire extinguishers nearby, the fire risks are huge. Cars abandoned in the building's basement were partly submerged in human waste that was overflowing into an adjacent alleyway. Litter was floating on top of this slow-moving sludge of sewage. Mr Maqoma showed the BBC a dark, unsanitary bathroom with a toilet that he said he flushes by pouring a bucket of water down it. \"When you flush [the toilet], it goes through to the basement,\" he said. The city's housing problems are not a recent phenomenon. Since apartheid and white-minority rule ended in 1994, many black and mixed-race residents moved from townships outside the city to the centre to be closer to their workplaces. This large influx of people put intense pressure on the supply of adequate housing. Coupled with under-investment and the departure of many wealthy landlords, this led to many buildings falling into neglect, and some became havens for illegal activity like hijacking. Joseph, which is not his real name, is a former hijacker who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity. He said he was hired by local criminals to \"clean\" a building and then \"put posters and write 'flat to rent'\". But collecting the rent was not the main business. \"The main business about the building is cooking the drugs,\" he said. \"They cook nyaope neat. Many buildings, plenty of them here in Jo'burg - they've been hijacked like that.\" Nyaope is a highly addictive street drug in South Africa, often containing substances like low-grade heroin, cannabis, antiretroviral drugs, and in some cases even rat poison. It can cause abdominal pain, respiratory issues and depression. Joseph said he was haunted by those who may have suffered as a result of what happened where he operated. \"Some of the time, when I'm sleeping, I can see people, I see people. People died in these buildings. People went missing. I'm sorry for the wrong path in my life,\" he told the BBC. Joseph said he had left the gang because he discovered other gang members were plotting to kill him, adding that he was relieved to leave his criminal life. But he gave some insight as to one possible reason that the hijacked building was not cleared by the authorities: corruption. Joseph claimed that evictions were prevented by \"having a good relationship with [the] city council and police\", which was a \"matter of [a] cash\" bribe. When asked about the allegations of collusion with building hijackers, the City of Johannesburg's deputy director of communications, Nthatisi Modingoane, said the council had no \"physical\" or \"credible reports\" that suggested there was \"any wrongdoing\". When it came to cracking down on criminal activities in hijacked buildings, the spokesperson said there had been \"operations where we found people with drugs... [and] illegal weapons and those cases are currently sitting with the South African police services for further investigation\". Mr Modingoane added that the council \"will intensify\" its operations tackling criminal activity in hijacked buildings and \"make sure that we clean the city\". The Johannesburg police did not respond to the BBC's request for comment on bribery and intimidation. The eviction of the residents of these derelict and hijacked buildings sounds like the simple answer to the problem. That could lead to much-needed redevelopment. But it would be an expensive exercise and legally not straightforward. In the first place, South Africa's constitution protects the right of people to have a home. This means once a person is settled in a building and they can prove they have nowhere else to go, they cannot be forced out unless the state provides alternative accommodation. This imposes a cost on the local authority, and moving people out of a building is expensive in itself. Johannesburg Central's sheriff, whose jurisdiction covers part of the inner city, said evictions could not be carried out on a larger scale or frequently because of financial constraints. Sheriff Marks Mangaba's role is to carry out instructions from courts, which includes dealing with evictions from buildings once a property owner obtains an eviction order. Landlords - either private or state - must pay for moving people out once they have obtained that order. But Mr Mangaba said larger scale evictions were a \"very costly exercise, it's millions of rands\". But even if the City of Johannesburg could afford to evict people in large numbers, it would create a mass homelessness crisis and the council would then have to provide accommodation. Furthermore, South Africa's Prevention of Illegal Eviction Act means that every eviction has to come with a court order meaning that attempts to move people can get snarled up in the legal system. Back in March, the president highlighted the importance for Johannesburg's hijacked buildings to be \"turned into living accommodations where our people can live lives of dignity\". But for many residents here, that vision remains hollow. At the MBV1 building, Mr Khetani said he had been living there since 2008 even though it was supposed to be temporary accommodation. The city council had told him that there was no permanent accommodation \"to go and put us into\", he said. \"The city has no money and nobody cares.\" Go toBBCAfrica.comfor more news from the African continent.

Some people in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are entitled to the money when there is a prolonged period of below-zero temperatures. In Scotland, those on low incomes and benefits may receive a separate winter heating payment, which does not depend on how cold it gets. The cold weather payment isa government benefit top-up to help with fuel bills. The average temperature in a local area must be recorded as, or forecast to be, 0C or below for seven days in a row. The temperature is recorded by the weather station nearest to your postcode. More than 1.4 million cold weather payments worth £35m were made during winter 2024-25. Of this, more than £9m was issued to those in receipt of pension credit. To qualify, you must live in England, Wales or Northern Ireland. Payments are not age-related but you must already be receiving certain benefits, including: Each cold weather payment is for a seven-day period and is worth £25. More than one payment will be made during the course of the winter if there are enough periods of cold weather. The scheme runs between 1 November and 31 March each year. Hospital stays can affect your entitlement to the payment so you should tellthe Pension ServiceorJobcentre Plusif you become an inpatient. You should also update the relevant service if you have a baby, or if a child under five comes to live with you. In Scotland,the winter heating payment is worth £59.75, and is being paid to those who are eligible from December 2025. You do not have to do anything in order to receive cold weather payments. The money should be paid automatically into the same bank or building society account as your benefits, within two weeks of the qualifying period of cold weather. If you do not receive a payment, you can contactthe Pension ServiceorJobcentre Plus. Cold weather payments do not affect other benefits. They are separate tothe winter fuel payment, which is worth £100 or £300 depending on your individual circumstances. About nine million pensioners will get the Winter Fuel Payment in 2025/2026, after a government U-turn over changes to the eligibility rules."}

What is the best way to heat your home and keep yourself safe and well during periods of cold weather? Keeping warm over the winter months can help to prevent colds, flu and more serious health problems such as heart attacks, strokes, pneumonia and depression,according to the NHS. Pensioners, children under the age of five, people with health conditions and those who are pregnant are most at risk. Wearing multiple layers of clothing - including thick socks and fingerless gloves - can help keep you warm if you are not moving. Family, friends and neighbours can play their part by ensuring anyone who is more vulnerable is well stocked up with food and necessary medicines, and that they can safely get in and out of their property by keeping any steps or paths clear of snow or ice. Many charities and councils run freewarm hubsin locations such as libraries and other community spaces. Check whether there are any quick fixes to make sure you are not wasting energy or heat. That could include turning off radiators in unused rooms, switching off lights when they are not needed, and not leaving electrical appliances on standby. Curtains should be open during the day, then drawn at dusk. Limit heat loss by using draught excluders to block gaps under doors or around windows. You can add metal, plastic or adhesive foam strips to fill any gaps. You can cover external keyholes and add a flap or brush to your letterbox, or hang a door curtain. You can put a chimney draught excluder inside any unused fireplaces, or make your own by filling a black bag with scrunched up paper. The Energy Saving Trust points out thatinternal doors should not be draught-proofedto allow the proper circulation of air throughout a property. Rugs can cover gaps between floorboards, and warm hard floors. Experts are divided on whether it is more efficient to keep your heating on permanently at a lower temperature or switch it on and off as required. Generally, using a thermostat to keep the room temperature between 18C and 21C is ideal for most. However, turning it down even one degree can save money, as can switching off radiators in unoccupied rooms. Older people and those with health conditions which limit their mobility are not advised to let temperatures drop below 18C in rooms they use regularly. Your heating system may have a timer function which lets you programme particular temperatures at different times of the day. Some wireless thermostats are connected to the internet and can be turned on remotely. Turning down your combi boiler's flow temperaturecan help the system run more efficiently, and save money. Make sure radiators are not blocked by curtains or furniture. Consider fitting reflector panels to those on external walls. If you are staying in one room for a long time, you may want to use a portable electric heater instead of turning on your central heating system. They should be plugged directly into a mains socket, placed on a flat surface, and be at least 3ft (1m) away from anything flammable such as curtains or furniture. Using gas heaters carries the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning, so you should ensure you have a working carbon monoxide alarm in the same room. You can also use electric blankets or heated throws on a timer function to ensure they don't overheat. Experts argue it is essential to eat and drink properly during periods of cold weather. Keep moving as much as you can between meals. Age UK recommends at least one hot meal a day such as soup or stew, and regular hot drinks like tea. Tinned soups, fruit and vegetables can be cheaper than fresh produce. You may be able to get support fromyour local food bank, although you might need to be referred first. Local community organisations can often arrange this. Don't overfill your kettle: only boil what you need. Batch cooking and freezing meal portions can also save money. Microwaves and air fryers can be cheaper to run than gas or electric ovens. Don't run your dishwasher unless it is full, and choose an eco-setting if you can. If your energy supplier offers discounts for off-peak use, try to use washing machines and other large appliances during the cheaper period. Limit your shower time to four minutes. Use a timer or make a playlist of four-minute songs. If you are struggling financially, thenask your energy supplier for help. Firms must offer customers affordable payment plans or repayment holidays if necessary. Most also provide hardship grants. Anyone on a prepayment meter who can't afford to top up can ask for a fuel voucher from their energy provider, or through their council. Local authorities in England may also be able to provide cost-of-living assistance throughthe household support fund. You canfind your local council here. Under theWarm Home Discount scheme, anyone on means-tested benefits in Great Britain willget £150 taken off their bills. About nine million pensioners will also getthe Winter Fuel Paymentin 2025/2026, worth £200 or £300, after a government U-turn over eligibility.

It's a wetland, known for its groundwater springs, but the plain is now dry and cracked with holes she explains were once pools. \"Before, the Vega was all green,\" she says. \"You couldn't see the animals through the grass. Now everything is dry.\" She gestures to some grazing llamas. For generations, her family raised sheep here. As the climate changed, and rain stopped falling, less grass made that much harder. But it worsened when \"they\" started taking the water, she explains. \"They\" are lithium companies. Beneath the salt flats of the Atacama Desert lie the world's largest reserves of lithium, a soft, silvery-white metal that is an essential component of the batteries that power electric cars, laptops and solar energy storage. As the world transitions to more renewable energy sources, the demand for it has soared. In 2021, about 95,000 tonnes of lithium was consumed globally - by 2024 it had more than doubled to 205,000 tonnes, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). By 2040 it's predicted to rise to more than 900,000 tonnes. Most of the increase will be driven by demand for electric car batteries, the IEA says. Locals say environmental costs to them have risen too. So, this soaring demand has raised the question: is the world's race to decarbonise unintentionally stoking another environmental problem? Chile is the second-largest producer of lithium globally after Australia. In 2023, the government launched a National Lithium Strategy to ramp up production through partly nationalising the industry and encouraging private investment. Its finance minister previously said the increase in production could be by up to 70% by 2030, although the mining ministry says no target has been set. This year, a major milestone to that is set to be reached. A planned joint enterprise between SQM and Chile's state mining company Codelco has just secured regulatory approval for a quota to extract at least 2.5 million metric tonnes of lithium metal equivalent from 2031 to 2060. Chile's government has framed the plans as part of the global fight against climate change and a source of state income. Mining companies predominantly extract lithium by pumping brine from beneath Chile's salt flats to evaporation pools on the surface. The process extracts vast amounts of water in this already drought-prone region. Faviola Gonzalez is a biologist from the local indigenous community working in the Los Flamencos National Reserve, in the middle of the Atacama Desert, home to vast salt flats, marshes and lagoons and some 185 species of birds. She has monitored how the local environment is changing. \"The lagoons here are smaller now,\" she says. \"We've seen a decrease in the reproduction of flamingos.\" She said lithium mining impacts microorganisms that birds feed on in these waters, so the whole food chain is affected. She points to a spot where, for the first time in 14 years, flamingo chicks hatched this year. She attributes the \"small reproductive success\" to a slight reduction in water extraction in 2021, but says, \"It's small.\" \"Before there were many. Now, only a few.\" The underground water from the Andes, rich in minerals, is \"very old\" and replenishes slowly. \"If we are extracting a lot of water and little is entering, there is little to recharge the Salar de Atacama,\" she explains. About a decade ago the Chilean government ratified applications from local managers of the San Pedro and Vilama rivers for an official declaration that said their river basins and tributaries were \"exhausted\". A University of Chile study in 2023 concluded that brine extraction was causing the Salar de Atacama to decline at a rate of between 1cm-2 cm per year. According to study author Dr. Francisco Delgado from the University of Chile: \"Subsidence due to irreversible changes in permeability can be a very serious problem.\" Then, last year, an OECD Environmental Performance Review of Chile noted: \"The pressures on water resources from lithium mining are already acute in the Atacama basin and will extend to other regions as lithium extraction ramps up.\" Damage to flora has also been found in some areas. On property in the salt flats, mined by the Chilean company SQM, almost one-third of the native \"algarrobo\" (or carob) trees had started dying as early as 2013 due to the impacts of mining, according to a report published in 2022 by the US-based National Resources Defense Council (NRDC). However, SQM say their own monitoring of carob trees shows numbers have risen. The issue extends beyond Chile too. The NRDC report claims that lithium mining is \"contributing to conditions of ecological exhaustion\", and \"may decrease freshwater availability for flora and fauna as well as humans\". He did, however, say that it is difficult to find \"definitive\" evidence on this topic. Environmental damage is of course inevitable when it comes to mining - not only lithium but also copper mining, which is a major industry in Chile. \"It's hard to imagine any kind of mining that does not have a negative impact,\" says Karen Smith Stegen, a political science professor at Constructor University in Germany, who studies the impacts of lithium mining across the world. The issue is that mining companies can take steps to mitigate that damage. \"What [mining companies] should have done from the very beginning was to involve these communities,\" she says. For example, before pumping lithium from underground, companies could carry out \"social impact assessments\" - reviews which take into account the broad impact their work will have on water, wildlife, and communities. For their part, mining companies now say they are listening. The Chilean firm SQM is one of the main players. At one of their plants in Antofagasta, Valentín Barrera, Deputy Manager of Sustainability at SQM Lithium, says the firm is working closely with communities to \"understand their concerns\" and carrying out environmental impact assessments. He feels strongly that in Chile and globally \"we need more lithium for the energy transition.\" He adds that the firm is piloting new technologies. If successful, the idea is to roll these out in their Salar de Atacama plants. These include both extracting lithium directly from brine, without evaporation pools, and technologies to capture evaporated water and re-inject it into the land. \"We are doing several pilots to understand which one works better in order to increase production but reduce at least 50% of the current brine extraction,\" he said. He says the pilot in Antofagasta has recovered \"more than one million cubic metres\" of water. \"Starting in 2031, we are going to start this transition.\" But the locals I spoke to are sceptical. \"We believe the Salar de Atacama is like an experiment,\" Faviola argues. She says it's unknown how the salt flats could \"resist\" this new technology and the reinjection of water and fears they are being used as a \"natural laboratory.\" Sara Plaza, whose family also raised animals in the same community as Raquel, is anxious about the changes she has seen in her lifetime. She remembers water levels dropping from as early as 2005 but says \"the mining companies never stopped extracting.\" Sara becomes tearful when she speaks about the future. \"The salt flats produce lithium, but one day it will end. Mining will end. And what are the people here going to do? Without water, without agriculture. What are they going to live on?\" \"Maybe I won't see it because of my age, but our children, our grandchildren will.\" She believes mining companies have extracted too much water from an ecosystem already struggling from climate change. \"It's very painful,\" she adds. \"The companies give the community a little money, but I'd prefer no money. \"I'd prefer to live off nature and have water to live.\" Sergio Cubillos is head of the association for the Peine community, where Sara and Raquel live. He says Peine has been forced to change \"our entire drinking water system, electrical system, water treatment system\" because of water shortages. \"There is the issue of climate change, that it doesn't rain anymore, but the main impact has been caused by extractive mining,\" he says. He says since it started in the 1980s, companies have extracted millions of cubic metres of water and brine – hundreds of litres per second. \"Decisions are made in Santiago, in the capital, very far from here,\" he adds. He believes that if the President wants to fight climate change, like he said when he ran for office, he needs to involve \"the indigenous people who have existed for millennia in these landscapes.\" Sergio understands that lithium is very important for transitioning to renewable energy but says his community should not be the \"bargaining chip\" in these developments. His community has secured some economic benefits and oversight with companies but is worried about plans to ramp up production. He says while seeking technologies to reduce the impact on water is welcome that \"can't be done sitting at a desk in Santiago, but rather here in the territory.\" Chile's government stresses there has been \"ongoing dialogue with indigenous communities\" and they have been consulted over the new Codelco-SQM joint venture's contracts to address concerns around water issues, new technologies and contributions to the communities. It says increasing production capacity will be based on incorporating new technologies to minimise the environmental and social impact and that the high \"value\" of lithium due to its role in the global energy transition could provide \"opportunities\" for the country's economic development. Sergio though worries about their area being a \"pilot project\" and says if the impact of new technology is negative, \"We will put all our strength into stopping the activity that could end with Peine being forgotten.\" The Salar de Atacama is a case study for a global dilemma. Climate change is causing droughts and weather changes. But one of the world's current solutions is – according to locals – exacerbating this. There is a common argument from people who support lithium mining: that even if it damages the environment, it brings huge benefits via jobs and cash. Daniel Jimenez, from lithium consultancy iLiMarkets, in Santiago, takes this argument a step further. He claims that environmental damage has been exaggerated by communities who want a pay-out. \"This is about money,\" he argues. \"Companies have poured a lot of money into improving roads, schools – but the claims of communities really go back to the fact they want money.\" But Prof Stegen is unconvinced. \"Mining companies always like to say, 'There are more jobs, you're going to get more money',\" she says. \"Well, that's not particularly what a lot of indigenous communities want. It actually can be disruptive if it changes the structure of their own traditional economy [and] it affects their housing costs. \"The jobs are not the be all and end all for what these communities want.\" In Chile, those I spoke to didn't talk about wanting more money. Nor are they opposed to measures to tackle climate change. Their main question is why they are paying the price. \"I think for the cities maybe lithium is good,\" Raquel says. \"But it also harms us. We don't live the life we used to live here.\" Faviola does not think electrifying alone is the solution to climate change. \"We all must reduce our emissions,\" she says. \"In developed countries like the US and Europe the energy expenditure of people is much greater than here in South America, among us indigenous people.\" \"Who are the electric cars going to be for? Europeans, Americans, not us. Our carbon footprint is much smaller.\" \"But it's our water that's being taken. Our sacred birds that are disappearing.\" Top image credit: Getty Images.

Both teams were beaten to gold by the Netherlands on the opening day in Santiago, Chile, with defending world champion Emma Finucane leading debutants Iona Moir and Rhianna Parris-Smith in the women's trio. Richardsonchanged his allegiancefrom Australia to the country of his birth after winning three medals at the 2024 Olympics. \"Coming away with a silver medal is bittersweet for me,\" said the 26-year-old. \"My first medal at a world championships in a GB skinsuit is going to feel amazing. I wish it was the top step, but I can't come away too mad about that.\" Richardson was joined by Joe Truman and Harry Ledingham-Horn in the men's qualifying line-up and they placed second behind the Netherlands, the two-time defending champions. GB then beat Germany in round one and Hamish Turnbull replaced Ledingham-Horn for the final. GB led as Richardson peeled off following the second lap but Jeffrey Hoogland managed to close the gap on the final lap, crossing the line 0.37 seconds before Turnbull. Richardson, who secured his sixth world medal overall, added: \"We're a fresh line-up, so each time we step on the track we're learning a little bit about each other.\" Truman added: \"It's the closest we've ever been to the Dutch and it's a really positive first step in the cycle [to LA 2028].\" Finucane has helped GB win a medal in the women's event at the past three world championships, claiming gold in Denmark last year. She also won individual gold at the past two worlds and led a new-look trio in Chile, which qualified fastest ahead of the Netherlands. GB then beat Colombia in round one before being beaten in the final by the Dutch, by 0.26secs. \"I'm so proud of these two,\" said Finucane, who won three medals at Paris 2024. \"It's their first world championships and to go out there in the gold medal ride-off, be composed, feel the pressure - we couldn't have asked for more.\" Maddie Leech is making her worlds debut in Chile and finished sixth in the women's scratch race. Finucane will begin her title defence in the women's sprint on Thursday while GB aim for a second straight gold in the women's team pursuit final.

A pair of jeans could easily be a size 10 by one brand and a size 14 in another, leaving customers confused and disheartened. It has led to a global deluge of returns, costing fashion retailers an estimated £190bn a year as would-be shoppers wonder what size they're meant to buy from which store. I didn't have to look far to find people experiencing the problem. \"I don't trust high-street sizing,\" one person tells me, as she browses one of London's popular shopping streets. \"To be honest, I buy by how it looks rather than the actual size.\" She's one of many women who often orders multiple versions of the same item to find one that fits, before sending the rest back, fuelling a culture of mass returns. A growing cluster of tech companies are now attempting to fix the problem. Tools such as 3DLook, True Fit and EasySize focus on helping customers choose the right size at checkout, using body scans via smartphone photos to suggest the most accurate fit. Meanwhile, virtual fitting-room platforms including Google's virtual try-on, Doji, Alta, Novus, DRESSX Agent and WEARFITS allow shoppers to create digital avatars and preview how items might look. These systems aim to increase confidence when buying online. More recently, AI-powered shopping agents have begun entering the market too. Daydream, allows users to describe what they are looking for and then recommends options. OneOff pulls together looks from celebrities to find similar items, while Phia scans tens of thousands of websites to compare prices and surface early \"size insights.\" While these tools work at the e-commerce stage, a new UK start-up, Fit Collective, is taking a different approach: trying to prevent the problem earlier in the production process. Founder Phoebe Gormley argues AI can potentially fix the sizing before clothes reach the stores. The 31-year-old - who is no data scientist, rather a tailor - previously launched Savile Row's first female tailors, making made-to-measure garments for a range of women. \"They would all come in and say, 'high-street sizing is so bad',\" she tells me. She says fashion's current model is a \"downward spiral\" where brands make cheaper garments to offset huge return rates, which leads to unhappy customers and more waste. Since launching last year, Fit Collective has raised £3 million in pre-seed funding, reportedly the largest amount ever secured by a solo female founder in the UK. \"As far as we know, we are the first solution comparing all the manufacturing data and the commercial data,\" she says. Phoebe's new venture uses machine learning to analyse a range of data - including returns, sales figures and customer emails - to really understand why something didn't fit. It then turns this into clear advice for design and production teams, who can adjust patterns, sizing and materials before manufacturing begins. Her system may tell a firm, for example, to take a few centimetres off the length of an item of clothing to reduce the number of returns overall. This saves money for the company and time for the consumer. While many in the industry welcome such tools, some warn technology alone won't fix fashion's sizing problem. \"People aren't mannequins, they're unique, and so are their fit preferences,\" says Paul Alger, Director of International Business at the UK Fashion and Textile Association. He warns sizing can be nuanced, with body measurements rarely aligning with a number on a label. \"It's very difficult, it's very subjective,\" he says. \"Most of us are a different shape and size - around the world people have different body shapes.\" And then there's the issue of vanity sizing - or \"emotional sizing\" according to Mr Alger - where a brand will deliberately choose to create a more generous fit in the knowledge that a consumer, especially in women's wear, will prefer to shop there. \"Once these sizing norms are established in a collection, brands will usually refer back to them each season so they are effectively creating their own brand sizing,\" he says. Sophie De Salis, sustainability policy adviser at the British Retail Consortium, says retailers are increasingly aware of the issue, from a cost-saving and sustainability perspective. \"Smarter sizing tech and AI-driven solutions are key to reducing returns and supporting the industry's sustainability goals. BRC members are working with innovative tech providers to help their customers buy the most suitable size and reduce returns,\" she says. With returns now a board room issue and sustainability pressures mounting, more fashion houses may well consider data-driven design. While no single solution is likely to solve inconsistent sizing completely, the emergence of tools like Fit Collective, alongside a growing ecosystem of virtual try-ons and size-prediction platforms, suggests the industry is beginning to shift.

As one of the best-known names in video games, it's a series that needs little introduction. According to publisher Activision, it's sold an estimated 500 million copies, amovie adaptationis on the way, and despite having launched in 2003 it still reliably appears at - or near - the top of the annual bestseller charts. But this year the world's top military shooter might have a fight on its hands. Battlefield 6, which has been a huge hit for rival gaming giant Electronic Arts, has been drawing attention away from its veteran competitor. And long-time Call of Duty fans have been increasingly vocal over worries about the series losing touch with its roots. The clash of the multiplayer titans comes at an interesting time for the makers of Call of Duty, who've had to issue responses tofan concerns about the series losing its way. It has long offered players the chance to purchase \"operator skins\" that change their character's appearance. They're a frequent source of brand crossovers, and previous designs have been based on stars including footballer Neymar Jr, streamer NickMercs and rapper Nicki Minaj. But when Activision revealed skins based on 90s cartoon characters Beavis and Butthead earlier this year, there was a backlash. Fans accused the company of trying to mimic Fortnite, the ever-popular multiplayer game famous for its sometimes unlikely crossovers, which haveincluded pop star Sabrina Carpenter and an AI-voiced Darth Vader in 2025. Activision said the feedback from fans \"hit home\" and that it took the complaints about the series losing its identity seriously. It's also being released after parent company Microsoftincreased prices of its Game Pass subscription service by 20%, angering many players. When BBC News sits down with lead producer Natalie Pohorski and senior comms director Stephanie Snowdon, they're keen to talk up Black Ops 7's single-player story campaign. The equivalent mode in Battlefield 6 was considered underwhelming by reviewers, and Call of Duty teams are renowned for their skill in crafting explosive set pieces in their narrative modes. Black Ops-themed installments of the series usually tell Hollywood blockbuster-style stories of secret agents uncovering vast conspiracies. Black Ops 7 is a direct sequel to 2012's Black Ops 2, set in 2035 and tells a story involving a global terrorist threat and a murky big tech company. Natalie says that the \"Black Ops identity\" allows the developers to explore themes that others can't. \"There's a lot of really interesting and timeless ideas... there's endless ways to explore them,\" she says. \"And then we ask a lot of questions that could apply to any era - questions of trust, can you believe what you're seeing?\" Being one of the biggest names in gaming also allows Activision to attract some big-name talent to Call of Duty projects. For Black Ops 7, that includes Kiernan Shipka, best known for her role in Netflix's Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, and This Is Us star Milo Ventimiglia. Kiernan tells BBC News she's aware of Call of Duty's huge profile, and the expectations of its fans. She says being involved was \"honestly more exciting than anything.\" \"And I think that when something over time garners such passion from fans, that means you're stepping into something really cool. \"The reaction is going to be what the reaction is going to be. \"If I let that stuff in, that's not a good thing.\" As someone who played Call of Duty when he was younger, Milo says he's also aware of the standards fans have. \"I mean, I hope I don't muck it up for anybody,\" he says. Asked whether he thinks players are getting \"fatigued\" with the annual series, he says Black Ops 7 won't disappoint. \"I think this one just blows the others out of the water completely in the storytelling and where we go,\" he says. But Call of Duty's campaigns, no matter how well-crafted or explosive they are, aren't the main reason players turn up for the series each year. The game owes its long-running success to the popularity of its multiplayer modes, and the performance of Black Ops 7 will be judged on whether they succeed. When they're asked if Battlefield's impressive player numbers affect their approach to development, Natalie and Stephanie insist they're only focused on making Black Ops 7 \"the best game it can be\". As for what it offers that Battlefield can't, Stephanie says, without directly comparing the two, that Call of Duty has \"variety and volume\" of experiences to offer. \"But more broadly, she says, \"I see games as a way for people to connect, to have fun. \"They are certainly responsible for some awesome relationships in my life. \"I hope that people continue to forge those connections and bonds and  relationships and there's just more of us playing games together in however many years from now.\" Listen to Newsbeatliveat 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen backhere."}

Injuries to Australia team-mates Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood have only pushed him further to the fore. The back-up bowler with the best average since 1914, kept on the sidelines by three all-time greats, is now a guaranteed starter. He nearly missed the start line altogether. Boland weighed around 115kg when arriving at Frankston before Jewell, who was still playing state cricket for Victoria at the time, set his player a challenge: lose 5kg over the next two months and he'd be picked in the first XI. \"Not long after we had that deal, I walked past his car and had a look in,\" Jewell says. \"There were still some KFC and McDonald's wrappers. I reminded him not very subtly about our deal. \"He swore to me they were old ones and he hadn't cleaned his car.\" Boland took 18 wickets in three matches in the most recent Ashes series down under Boland fulfilled his part of the bargain. His journey to cricket's summit is a throwback - a far cry from academy pathways and state under-age teams. \"His transformation over two years was hard to believe,\" Jewell says. \"He is almost like a hired assassin. He is so calm, cool and collected. \"You very rarely see a change in his attitude or demeanour whether it is going good or bad. \"At times you thought as a coach, 'Am I getting through to this bloke?' but you saw it in the changes in his game and performances.\" Success in the Melbourne grade system and years of wicket-taking in the Sheffield Shield opened the door to an initial foray in white-ball cricket. Seen as a yorker specialist for the death overs, Boland played three T20s and 14 one-day internationals in 2016, around the same time he learned of his Indigenous roots through his maternal grandfather, which would take him on a tour of England with an Aboriginal XI in 2018. It is the start to Boland's Test career that has been a statistical phenomenon, however. Sixty-two wickets at an average of 16.53. At home those wickets cost just 12.63 runs. No Australian to have taken as many as him - not Shane Warne, nor Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc or Josh Hazlewood - can better that record in the game's history. \"Warney used to talk about developing a new ball every year,\" says his state coach Chris Rogers, the former Australia opener. \"It is almost like Scotty has figured out one more thing every year and just keeps adding to his weaponry and his skill.\" He adds: \"Bowling yorkers and delivering them under pressure was a skillset he owned for a while. \"The white-ball game has changed though and it is probably more about your change-ups and sequencing of different deliveries through an over and so forth. \"From that point of view he has then switched over to Test cricket.\" After 14 Tests, Boland stands as the most accurate pace bowler in the database of analysts CricViz. He may not hoop the ball or deliver it at frightening speeds but, helped by the pace and bounce of Australian pitches and a new Kookaburra ball that seams, he has made a habit of finding enough movement to take a batter's edge or beat their defence. \"When we do our measuring in terms of lines and lengths he is always at the top of our lists,\" Rogers says. \"Every time he gets the ball he is almost exactly the same.\" While a hat-trick against West Indies earlier this year added to the list of achievements, it is six scalps on debut that have gone down in Australian sporting legend. Haseeb Hameed's thin snick, Jack Leach bowled shouldering arms, Jonny Bairstow pinned lbw, Joe Root's edged drive, Mark Wood taken in the follow-through and Ollie Robinson snaffled at third slip. \"We didn't know an awful lot about him,\" Leach recalls. \"He seemed to be moving the ball just the perfect amount both ways and was finding the edge. \"I remember how relentless it was, him hitting his length hard. \"It wasn't that it was fast but how hard he hit the pitch and that he made the ball talk.\" Boland has described that day as \"life-changing\". In a spell of 24 deliveries, an introvert became a cult hero. \"He found it challenging,\" Rogers says. \"A guy that has gone through his whole career where he has had to earn everything and chip away at it to have a day like that where everything comes together. \"He is a bit reclusive in some respects but that is the charm of it as well.\" Jewell recognises those traits from the Adrian Butler Oval. \"Because he came into the system a long way back and didn't go through the pathway system he probably had nothing to be overly confident or chest beating about but that is probably not the type of guy he is anyway,\" he says. \"You see when he gets 6-7 at the G you struggle to get a smile out of him.\" Instead, consistency has been Boland's big strength. \"His floor is his ceiling\" is how Rogers neatly describes it. \"It is just the same performances day in day out,\" he adds. But in the 2023 Ashes series, with less bounce and seam movement on offer in England, that repeatability became a weakness. Ben Stokes' Bazballers knew where the ball would be pitched and attacked. The result was two wickets in two appearances. He was not seen again after England won the third Test in Leeds. \"He will have thought to himself what could he do better,\" Rogers says. \"It might not have been anything technical, more how did he react in the moment and how are his mental skills through that. \"He might have been a bit surprised it happened. He is going into this series with his eyes wide open.\" Domestically this season Boland has been near his relentless best. He has taken 14 wickets in three matches at an average back in the mid-teens and, as Rogers puts it, provided a match-winning five-wicket haul \"not many in the world could do\" on a final-day pitch against New South Wales. \"He is tapering nicely to the first Test,\" Rogers says. \"When the news came through about Pat Cummins it was almost like 'OK I have got to be cherry ripe'.\" Those early days are long gone.

Eight years later, employers are able to turn to AI instead of hiring staff, and graphic design graduates like her said they felt they were \"competing\" against the technology to get a job. Major companies are already starting to use the technology in their marketing campaigns, which is narrowing the number of vacancies and increasing clients' expectations for faster work results. \"Because AI can create things so quickly, clients expect designers to do the same, but we take a lot more of a personal approach,\" said Ms Hutchby, 27, a Birmingham City University graduate. In 2022, Heinz generated 12 images of ketchup using the intelligence tool OpenAI for an advert. Coca-Cola created a fully AI-generated ad for Christmas last year featuring the brand's iconic truck with consumers drinking Coca-Cola Zero Sugar. Fashion brand Mango came under fire for usingAI teen models in their campaign Sunset Dream,as people argued it was taking jobs away from humans and should be considered as \"false advertising\". Ms Hutchby spent more than a year finding a permanent creative job after graduating from university in 2020, a process which made her question her degree when applications didn't receive a response. \"I did think, 'Oh God, what have I done? I've just spent all this money and time on a degree, but am I even going to get a chance to use it?',\" she said. The graduate, who is looking for freelance graphic design work in Birmingham, has decided to upskill in animation so she can stand out to clients, offer a range of services and \"bring as many strings to the bow as possible\". According to the not-for-profit organisation World Economic Forum (WEF), graphic design jobs will be one of thefastest declining roles by 2030due to the rise in AI. It is one of many industries affected by the technology, as companies use it to cut down on employee numbers, an example being the buy now, pay later company Klarna. The company introduced an AI assistant for customer service, and says use of the technology has since been expanded to the equivalent of 800 human roles. Ashleigh Sadler graduated from Sheffield Hallam University with a degree in graphic design in the summer. She thinks her university could have prepared students more about the developments of AI and how difficult it would be to find a job after graduating. \"AI is damaging for small businesses, and it is taking opportunities away from designers. It's worrying when you're trying to break out in the industry,\" she said. The 21-year-old from Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, said she was almost tempted to retrain as a paramedic, as the job hunt proved difficult with fewer companies willing to hire staff. \"I've put all this effort in, studying for five years for AI to come round now. It made me question the degree and think, 'What have I been doing all this work for?'\" Now working at a marketing agency company, she said she was \"really grateful\" to have secured a job, as she knew a lot of people who were struggling to find work. University of Brighton graduate Grace Warren said she felt like she was \"thrown into the deep end\" after finishing her course this year and left without much advice on internships and the industry. \"I felt far from fully prepared, and I think the industry has changed so much since lecturers went to uni,\" she said. The 22-year-old from Bath has mixed opinions on AI. She believes it's an opportunity for graduates to become experts in the technology and use it to their advantage for future careers. However, she said it was easy to feel pressurised into becoming a \"robot\" and learning an endless number of skills to fit job descriptions. \"Feeling threatened by AI is a real thing, you are competing against it and it makes you feel extra pressure to do even better,\" she said. Dr Rebecca Ross from Central Saint Martins, University of the Arts London said it was a misconception that AI would \"kill\" the graphic design industry, as designers would adapt and use it in \"unexpected ways\". \"Graphic design has always developed in step with technological change - from letterpress to phototypesetting to desktop publishing and now Gen AI,\" she said. Dr Ross said AI could open up new opportunities for designers, but it was \"impossible\" to fully predict how it would change the industry. One aspect that is changing is what employers look for in entry-level jobs - while some companies want graduates to help them use AI, others look to hire people with \"distinct voices\" to stand out against the technology's \"churn\". \"In this sense, the practiced human hand and human eye remain as important as ever,\" Dr Rebecca Ross said. Milk&Tweed, a creative agency based in Wiltshire, said it looked out for someone with a proactive mindset and attitude when hiring staff members. \"I always like to hear people say, 'This is a project I did for free for my mum's business', or 'My dad's mate', as to me that shows that you enjoy it,\" founder Jake Jeffries said. He said that ideas were as important as ever to a portfolio, and having software knowledge like Adobe and gaining real-life experience \"off your own back\" helped graduates stand out. Mr Jeffries encouraged people to pay attention to trends, as they were \"defining factors\" of a project and would help designs to stay remembered.

Thousands of users began reporting issues with the sites, as well as other services, to outage monitoring site Downdetector shortly after 11:30 GMT. Cloudflare said the \"significant outage\" occurred after a configuration file designed to handle threat traffic did not work as intended and \"triggered a crash\" in its software handling traffic for its wider services. \"We apologise to our customers and the Internet in general for letting you down today,\" it said in a statement. \"Given the importance of Cloudflare's services, any outage is unacceptable,\" the company added. It said while the issue had been resolved, some services might still encounter errors as they came back online. A wide range of apps and websites were impacted by the outage. Users reported encountering delays or technical issues when trying to access services such as Grindr, Zoom and Canva. Meanwhile social media platform X (formerly Twitter) was displaying a message on its homepage for some users which said there was a problem with its internal server due to an \"error\" originating with Cloudflare. ChatGPT's site was also displaying an error message telling some users: \"please unblock challenges cloudflare.com to proceed.\" Cloudflare is a huge provider of internet security across the world, carrying out services such as checking visitor connections to sites are coming from humans rather than bots. It says 20% of all websites worldwide use its services in some form. The range of sites affected was demonstrated by the fact Downdetector itself - a site many flock to when sites stop loading or appear to have issues - also displayed an error message as many tried to access it on Tuesday. Alp Toker, director of NetBlocks, which monitors the connectivity of web services, said the outage \"points to a catastrophic disruption to Cloudflare's infrastructure\". \"What's striking is how much of the internet has had to hide behind Cloudflare infrastructure to avoid denial of service attacks in recent years,\" he told the BBC - highlighting how the company aims to protect sites against malicious attempts to overwhelm them with traffic requests. He said that however, as a result of this - and the convenience of its services - it had also become \"one of the internet's largest single points of failure.\" Cloudflare has stressed the problem was the result of a technical problem. \"To be clear, there is no evidence that this was the result of an attack or caused by malicious activity,\" it said in its statement. The company's share price was trading around 3% lower shortly after 15:00 GMT. Issues affecting Cloudflare's services come after an outage impacting Amazon Web Services last month sawmore than 1,000 sites and apps knocked offline. Another major web services provider, Microsoft Azure,was also affected shortlyafterwards. \"The outages we have witnessed these last few months have once again highlighted the reliance on these fragile networks,\" said Jake Moore, global cybersecurity advisor at ESET. \"Companies are often forced to heavily rely on the likes of Cloudflare, Microsoft, and Amazon for hosting their websites and services, as there aren't many other options.\" Sign up for our Tech Decoded newsletterto follow the world's top tech stories and trends.Outside the UK?

Ah yes, for me, as a woman in my 40s, it's coincided with perimenopause – the stage in my life where my hormone levels are changing. There can of course be other neurological conditions for which brain fog can be a symptom too. If you're in a job where public speaking is part of what you do, it can be particularly terrifying. \"I've spent 30 years being professionally articulate,\" wrote Janet Edgecombe, an internal communications expert. \"All of a sudden I'm forgetting the words for basic things. 'That grey thing in the thingy that we cook chicken on'. My husband replies 'oh, the baking tray in the oven'. Hmm. 'Yeah, that thing'.\" I also heard from teachers, start-up founders having to present pitches for money to investors, women running workshops, delivering speeches – and fellow journalists trying to report live on-air, like me. But of course it can also hit mid-conversation, in a more intimate but no less frustrating way. My post was about my decision to hold a page of notes on the BBC News at Ten. A story had broken late in the afternoon, following an already busy day, and by the time we reached 10pm, I knew I was getting tired and I could feel the brain fog. I was going to talk about an outage that was affecting dozens of websites and apps, and I planned to use the technical jargon for it, as given by the company affected, and then explain what it actually meant. But I just couldn't get the phrase to stick in my head and I knew that without it, I wouldn't manage the rest of what I needed to say. I was reporting live from Glasgow. Like many of my professional peers, I do not have, and I've never had, autocue. And so, for the first time, I decided at the last minute to hold a page of notes with the offending phrase on it. It felt to me at the time like an admission of failure. I have been trained never to use notes – unless there's a specific legal reason why the wording of a statement, for example, has to be precise, or there are a lot of figures to remember. Even then, I have prided myself on having a good enough short-term memory to get me through. Using notes is discouraged in the world of public speaking. They are not permitted to anyone giving a 12-minute TED talk. The speaker is expected to memorise their speech. Looking down the barrel of the camera and clutching that paper, live on TV, felt tough. But around 10% of women reportleaving their jobsdue to menopause symptoms, according to the Fawcett Society. And research by insurance firm Royal London found that half of women going through it haveconsidered giving up work.I don't want to do that – and so I stuck with my solution. To my intense relief, some people said they thought my paper looked authoritative, that they just assumed it was a breaking story and the page contained fresh information. Others asked why I hadn't used a device instead – I suppose I thought the potential of having to fumble with a screen would feel even worse. \"Let's start a movement: Hold your notes,\" wrote Elisheva Marcus, vice president of communications at the venture capitalist firm Earlybird. And so, the hashtag holdthenotes was born. \"Have you ever checked your testosterone levels?\" menopause expert Dr Louise Newson asked me. She says testosterone – despite its reputation for being a male hormone, and its association with sex drive and libido, is actually an essential brain chemical for both men and women, and levels fall in both genders. One of the results is brain fog. \"It's like you've been drugged,\" she says. \"It's really scary, a lot of people worry they've got dementia.\" \"I remember when I had my levels done 10 years ago, and I was like 'Thank God, at least I know why I'm feeling so awful'.\" She adds that there are studies dating back to the 1940s indicating that testosterone can improve brain function andwellbeing in womenas well as men, but the randomised control studies, where participants are given either a placebo or the product itself in order to see whether it really works, have only focused on improvements to libido. NHS-prescribedHormone Replacement Therapy,or HRT, is traditionally a combination of oestrogen and progesterone. Testosterone is not routinely included. Instead doctors can separately prescribe testosterone to female patients, at lower doses than given to men. There are also a myriad of menopause supplements which claim to ease symptoms including brain fog. Estimates vary but it's a multi-billion dollar industry and its booming. Women spend an averageof £147 per year on supplementsto try to alleviate their menopause symptoms, according to a survey earlier this year by the nutrition news website NutraIngredients. \"They might help a bit,\" says Dr Newson. \"I do yoga every day, and that helps my brain become clear and focused, but I have a hormone deficiency, I can't eat my way out of it, or exercise my way out of it. \"A lot of women spend a fortune trying to improve symptoms of a hormone deficiency with something else.\" Dr Joshua Chen is part of the Harvard Medical School-Massachusetts General Hospital Photobiomodulation Research Group. The team is looking at how frequencies of red light can change the mitochondria inside the brain to improve focus. He describes it as \"like a face mask, but for the brain\". It can also, he says, be applied to the Vagus nerve on the neck to reduce stress. He has founded a company called Niraxx which markets a headband called a neuro espresso, which is designed to be worn for up to 20 minutes a day. He claims the results are instant. It has to be plugged in – there are no batteries in the device for safety reasons. Angela Marsh is a registered nurse and a menopause coach. She says her clients often describe brain fog as feeling like they are \"living life in soft focus\". \"I don't think brain fog is taken seriously enough at all,\" she says. \"Many women feel deeply unsettled by the changes they experience. They think there's something wrong with them or they're 'losing it' when in fact there's a clear biological reason.\" As for me – well, I've booked a blood test to check my hormone levels. I'm going to try some red-light therapy. And you are probably going to see me holding notes a bit more often."}

Neil Barnby, from Hull, has mastered the art of balloon fashion and has seen his outfits worn by influencers and celebrities. One of his dresses was worn by US model Alex Consani for a feature in The Face magazine, while Girls Aloud singer Nadine Coyle has been photographed in another of his designs. Mr Barnby said balloon art was more than just a hobby to him, it was his passion. He said: \"It's just that sense of achievement when it's finished. It's wearable art, so it's just like asking an artist why they paint pictures.\" He added: \"I started making dogs for children's parties and then I just felt that there was more you could do with balloons. I just enjoy it so much.\" Mr Barnby moved on from balloon animals to cartoon characters and dolls with woven skirts, which he made for children's parties. He said he had then been inspired to make balloon dresses after seeing photos online of similar gowns in America. He creates his designs alongside his day job as a product manager for the government. Hundreds of balloons are used to make each garment, taking hours to construct. Each balloon is blown up, then twisted into hundreds of individual bubbles and woven together. \"They just take a lot of skill and time to make,\" Mr Barnby said. \"They will take anywhere between seven and 22 hours to make. The big, extravagant ones are obviously at the top end of that scale and can involve even a thousand balloons.\" Mr Barnby creates his designs in his conservatory at his home in Hull, which he shares with his daughter, Evangeline, 23. She said she was really proud of her dad. \"When I was about 10 or 11 he started making these balloon dresses and I just thought it was really cool. It's awesome,\" she said. Model Bel Hewin, who has worn a balloon dress made by Mr Barnby, said it was surprisingly comfortable. She said: \"It's pretty loud to put on, but once you're in it, it feels like a second skin almost. It's quite versatile.\" And Mr Barnby insisted you can definitely sit down in a balloon dress. He added: \"It's probably one of the most common questions that I get. And you can, because of the weight being distributed across several bubbles, it doesn't pop the balloons. \"Once they've completely deflated after a couple of months, you actually end up with a miniature version of the dress like something you could put on a small doll. \"So you've got a little keepsake, and from an environmental point of view it's not something we're making and throwing away.\""}

In a statement posted on social media on Saturday night, the broadcaster said it \"didn't get it right\" and that it would be \"stopping all activity\" on the account. The channel, which was only announced on Thursday, was described by the broadcaster as an \"inclusive, dedicated platform for women to enjoy and explore content from all sports, while amplifying female voices and perspectives.\" However, many on social media criticised the \"little sister\" account, which talked about \"hot girl walks\" and matcha in its content. At its inception, Sky said Halo's aim was \"to build a welcoming community for female fans, whether casual or committed, through fun, trend-led, and relatable content\". One post saw a clip of Manchester City players Rayan Cherki and Erling Haaland combining for the latter to score against Bournemouth, given the caption \"How the matcha + hot girl walk combo hits\". Viewers argued the posts were \"infantilising\" and undermined the work done over the past few years to put women's sport in the spotlight. Among those criticising the channel was Emily Trees, 23, who told BBC Newsbeat that she thought Halo calling themselves the \"little sister\" of Sky Sports was a \"really damaging\" thing to say. \"We've spent the last 50 years trying to come away from the stereotypes around women's sport, and trying to make women's sport seen as an entity in itself rather than just as an extension of what men can do. We deserve our own space, something that's ours. We don't need to be the 'little sister' to anyone,\" she said. GirlsontheBall, a prominent platform covering women's football, voiced its frustrations saying on X they could not \"imagine this is what women sports fans want\". \"Have many thoughts which I will get to when not under a mountain of writing but all I can ask is why? The branding (one day can we please be past the pink/peach stage?!), the premise, the copy…\" Sports fan Millie Jones, 27, told BBC Newsbeat that she did not think women needed a separate space for content, rather, she says, they need to be equally represented in the content Sky Sports already put out. \"As a sports fan, I've consumed generic Sky Sports media for the entirety of the time that I've been into sport. I don't need a pink, glittery sidepiece to the normal content,\" she said. One user said that Sky Sports Halo was one of the worst concepts he had ever seen. \"So condescending. Creating a dumbed down sports channel for women is unbelievably sexist. Incredible that it was approved and that it's still live,\" they said. Some social media users have also created spoof posts of the channel's content which have been widely shared. While the channel was aimed at women many of the sports stars featured in its posts were men. Andy Gill, head of social media and audience development at Sky Sports, wrote on LinkedIn that he \"couldn't be prouder and more excited about [Halo's] launch\", but by Saturday night the broadcaster was forced to rethink. All but two posts have been deleted from the Halo account, one of which is a brief statement from Sky which reads: \"Our intention for Halo was to create a space alongside our existing channel for new, young, female fans. \"We've listened. We didn't get it right. As a result we're stopping all activity on this account. We're learning and remain as committed as ever to creating spaces where fans feel included and inspired.\" The BBC contacted Sky for comment but it had nothing further to add. Correction 16 November: An earlier version of this story incorrectly referred to one post as having been published by Halo but it was a mock-up not produced by the channel."}

Charlton, 22, then doubled the gold tally, winning GB's first world title in the individual pursuit since Bradley Wiggins in 2008. A good start saw 21-year-old Tarling take points in the opening sprint, then secure maximum points in sprint three before he powered clear to gain a lap. That gave him the lead and he continued to accumulate points, including the maximum again in sprint 11, to win gold in style. Track Worlds debutant Tarling becomes the first British man to win the points race title since Jonathan Dibben in 2016. \"I didn't know how [my first World Championships] would be or how it would feel , so not knowing was scary,\" Tarling said. \"It felt pretty good.

Authorities raised the reward for information leading to the arrest of Ryan Wedding from $10m (£7.6m) to $15m, calling him a modern-day Pablo Escobar, referring to the Colombian drug lord. FBI Director Kash Patel said Mr Wedding, 44, was \"responsible for engineering a narco trafficking and narco terrorism programme that we have not seen in a long time\". The US officials said they believe the Canadian, one of the FBI's 10 most wanted, is living in Mexico under the Sinaloa drug cartel's protection. US Attorney General Pam Bondi alleged that Mr Wedding was behind the murder of a federal witness in a case against him. He allegedly placed a bounty by having photos of the witness and his wife posted to a Canadian-based website, The Dirty Newz, in October 2024 to help locate him.The websitehas since removed by the FBI. The witness was shot and killed in a restaurant in Medellin, Colombia, in January. Bondi said Mr Wedding had also been charged with two additional counts of witness tampering and intimidation, murder, money laundering and drug trafficking. During a news conference on Wednesday, US and Canadian law enforcement officials announced a series of other developments in a case against Mr Wedding, including a new indictment and 10 arrests of suspects. RCMP Commissioner Michael Duheme said seven Canadians allegedly linked to the cartel were arrested on Tuesday in the provinces of Quebec, Ontario and Alberta, and would be extradited to the US. They have been charged with offences including conspiracy to commit murder and drug trafficking. Among them is Deepak Balwant Paradkar, a Canadian lawyer who is accused of providing \"a range of illegal services to Wedding and his drug trafficking organization beyond the scope of a normal attorney-client relationship\", the US treasury department said in a release. They allege Mr Paradkar was paid with \"luxury watches and additional fees for these illegal services\". The BBC has attempted to contact Mr Paradkar through his office for comment. An eighth person in Canada is still being sought by authorities. Mr Duheme estimated that Mr Wedding's cartel brings in more than $1bn a year. Mr Wedding competed in Giant Slalom snowboarding for Canada during the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. His aliases include \"El Jefe,\" \"Giant,\" \"Public Enemy,\" \"James Conrad King,\" and \"Jesse King\", the FBI has said. The FBI alleges that he has ordered dozens of murders across the globe, including in the US, Canada and Latin America."}

Charred furniture, lecterns and smoky curls of carpet are piled around the entrance - its guts emptied, and debris cleared, in time for Friday prayers. Dozens of men arrived for the prayers in a show of defiance - their backs turned towards the scorched and blackened wall. The imam here, Ahmad Salman, told the BBC the attack on Thursday was a message from Jewish settlers, amid a wave of settler violence across the West Bank. \"The message they want to send is that they can reach anywhere - into cities, into villages, that they can kill civilians and burn houses and mosques.\" \"I feel it in my soul,\" he said. \"It's not right to touch places of prayer, wherever they are.\" But there was a message here, too, for Israel's regional military chief - scrawled in Hebrew on the mosque's exterior wall: \"We're not afraid of you, Avi Bluth.\" Spiralling settler attacks here over the past six weeks have triggered tough warnings from army leaders, along with a handful of arrests and investigations. But expansionist settlers enjoy government support, which some believe is pushing the West Bank towards a dangerous confrontation. The annual olive harvest, when Palestinians try to access their farmland, often marks a spike in violence, but the attacks this year have broken UN records. The UN Office for Humanitarian Affairs registered more than 260 settler attacks resulting in Palestinian casualties or damage to property in October alone - the highest monthly count since they began monitoring in 2006. Human rights groups say that settler aggression towards Palestinians has risen since the Gaza War began in 2023 after the 7 October Hamas attacks. UN figures suggest that more than 3,200 Palestinians have been forcibly displaced by settler violence and restrictions since then. In the past few days, there have been several attacks across the West Bank, including an assault by a large crowd of masked men on an industrial estate and Bedouin buildings near Beit Lid. Security cameras filmed them running across the hillside and through the factory gates, where they torched several trucks.  The army said they later attacked Israeli soldiers operating nearby. The Israel police spokesman said four suspects had been arrested. Three have reportedly since been released. Last week, in the olive groves around Beita, a Reuters journalist, Raneen Sawafta, was beaten by a settler with a club as she was covering the olive harvest - a deep dent in her helmet clearly showing the force of the blows. Hamad al-Jagoub abu Rabia, a volunteer with the Red Crescent in Beita, was also injured after going to help her - hit in the head with a rock and later taken to hospital. \"I never imagined a human being created by God would do this,\" he said. \"If they had an iota of humanity, they would have never done this to a woman. If it wasn't for her helmet, she could have died.\" Less than three weeks earlier, 55-year-old Afaf Abu Alia wasbadly beaten with a clubas she lay cowering on the ground during a settler attack, after picking olives on farmland she rents near the village of Abu Falah. The video of her assault drew international condemnation. \"One of [the settlers] attacked me and started beating me - hitting my head, my arms and legs, and kicking my legs with their boots,\" she told the BBC. \"I fell down. I wasn't aware of what was happening, my mind went blank - I was only feeling the pain. I felt like my soul was leaving my body. The only thing I thought about was my children.\" Now recovering at home, Afaf said she was still in pain, with 20 stitches in her head, and bruises on her arms and legs that left her unable to sleep. She said the family had been blocked from its own farmland by settlers, and that they had been renting land elsewhere to grow olives this year. \"I'd return there today if I could, I'm not afraid of them,\" Afaf said. But she also acknowledged the situation was becoming riskier. \"They weren't like this at the start of the war,\" she said. \"In this one year, they've escalated more than in all the years before.\" One man has been arrested in connection with her assault. Arrests like this are rare, and convictions rarer still. The Israeli human rights organisation Yesh Din found that, over the past two decades, more than 93% of police investigations into Israeli offences against Palestinians in the West Bank were closed with no charges filed. Israeli forces have long been criticised by human rights groups for standing idly by during settler attacks - or even taking part in them. This week, Israel's chief of staff said he strongly condemned the recent violence by Israeli settlers, calling it \"a red line\" and promising to \"act decisively\". The head of the army's central command, Maj Gen Avi Bluth - the man addressed in the graffiti on Hamida Mosque - said violent acts by what he called \"anarchist fringe youth\" were \"unacceptable and extremely serious\" and must be dealt with firmly. Some hardline settlers see these comments as a betrayal. Amichai Luria, a long-time settler from Ma'ale Levona and manager of a winery in the nearby settlement of Shiloh, told me the current focus on settler violence was overblown. \"It's amazing to me how people talk about these rare occasions [when] people misbehave,\" he said. \"Oh, some people were trying to pick olives and some Jews came and bothered them. Give me a break. There are more muggings on the main street in London than there [are] here.\" I asked him about the severe beating of women and the near-daily reports of incidents in surrounding areas. He dismissed them as an \"attempt to make the Jews look bad\". \"Most of the Arabs, if they could, would follow Hamas or Hezbollah. Very, very, very few want to coexist or live in peace, and at the first opportunity they have, they're going to wipe us out,\" he said. \"The future is very simple. Hopefully the army will wake up, hopefully people will understand that we have to prepare ourselves, that they're coming for us.\" The UN's Office of Humanitarian Affairs says that, of the 1,000 Palestinians killed in the West Bank since the Gaza War began, between 20 and 32 were killed by Israeli settlers. During the same period, it says, Palestinians killed 19 Israeli civilians. The decision of military leaders to order action on settler violence will test discipline in an army where settlers make up a growing proportion of troops. It also risks exposing dangerous divisions between Israel's military and political leaders. Extremist settlers say their claim to the land comes from the Bible - but their growing confidence comes from government support. Since the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023 and the Gaza War that followed, Israel's far-right National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, has handed out more than 100,000 weapons to civilian security squads, including in West Bank settlements, and has urged Israel to formally annex the West Bank. The government has authorised a sharp expansion of settlements, and legalised some unauthorised outposts. Israeli settlements in the West Bank are illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. And the Defence Minister, Israel Katz, last year banned the use of administrative detention for Jewish settlers in the West Bank - reportedly against the advice of Israel's national security agency. Israel's army is now asking Katz to reinstate that power to help curb settler violence.  Administrative detention, which allows suspects to be held for renewable six month periods without charge, is still widely used for Palestinians. \"I don't trust the army like I used to,\" Amichai Lurai told me. \"A lot of people in the army are anti-Israel from top to bottom. Trust me, the army is not unified.\" Israel's army is currently embroiled in a legal and political scandal aroundleaked video footageallegedly showing the abuse of Palestinian detainees - a case that has pitted ultranationalist politicians against the country's security forces. As worshippers left the Hamida Mosque after Friday prayers, Israeli activists arrived on a visit to show solidarity.  Martin Goldberg, originally from London, was one of them. I asked him about Israeli claims that attacks by settlers were overblown. \"They're very minor attacks, when it's not happening to you,\" he said. \"These attacks are not minor, they're extremely major. Everyone's trying to belittle it, [saying] oh it's just the 'weeds in the field' but it's not. And they're being supported by the government. Local councils are 100% behind them, financing them.\" Many local councils provide backing and support to outposts, but have publicly condemned the violence of some settlers there. The chairman of the West Bank Settler Council this week issued a statement supporting the Israeli army in arresting the \"anarchists\" who harmed soldiers and civilians. \"Europe, the United States, everyone in the whole world is watching the West Bank,\" said Wadi abu Awad, a civil engineer who lives in the nearby village of Turmus Aya, which has seen repeated attacks. \"We are not in a fight with the Israelis. We don't kill Israeli soldiers, we don't have any hostages. And they [settlers] are pushing us towards the corner. You know, if the cat is pushed the corner, he might become a tiger.\""}

The court said evidence indicated the new voting districts were \"racially gerrymandered\", and ordered the state to use the congressional lines they had in place before they redistricted earlier this year. Republicans in the state legislature redrew voting districts mid-decade, sparking both Democrat and Republican-led states to follow suit and adjust their maps for a political edge ahead of next year's midterm elections. Texas Governor Greg Abbott has filed an appeal against the ruling to the US Supreme Court. Gerrymandering - the redrawing of electoral boundaries to favour a political party - is practised by both main parties and is legal unless ruled to be racially motivated. Critics argue that the process allows politicians to pick their voters, rather than voters picking their elected officials. The 2-1 ruling in Texas orders the state to set aside the newly approved maps, and instead use the ones created in 2021 by the Texas legislature. \"The public perception of this case is that it's about politics,\" US Judge Jeffrey Brown, a Trump appointee, wrote in the decision. \"To be sure, politics played a role in drawing the 2025 Map. But it was much more than just politics. Substantial evidence shows that Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 Map.\" The leader of the Democrats in the statehouse, Gene Wu, praised the ruling, saying in a statement that \"a federal court just stopped one of the most brazen attempts to steal our democracy that Texas has ever seen\". \"Greg Abbott and his Republican cronies tried to silence Texans' voices to placate Donald Trump, but now have delivered him absolutely nothing,\" said Wu. Governor Abbott said in a statement that the ruling was \"clearly erroneous and undermines the authority the U.S. Constitution\". \"The Legislature redrew our congressional maps to better reflect Texans' conservative voting preferences – and for no other reason,\" said Abbott. \"Any claim that these maps are discriminatory is absurd and unsupported by the testimony offered during ten days of hearings.\" The maps voted through in August by the Texas legislature, and approved by the state's Republican governor, create five new Republican-leaning districts. California voted to redraw its own maps earlier this month, leading to the creation of five Democrat-leaning seats. Earlier this month, a judge in Utah rejected an electoral map drawn by Republican lawmakers and ordered the adoption of a new map that would create one Democrat-leaning district in the state."}

A squad boasting talents such as Victor Osimhen, Ademola Lookman and Alex Iwobi could not clinch one of the 48 places at the expanded 2026 finals after beingbeaten on penalties by DR Congoin Africa's play-off final on Sunday night. It was at the 1994 finals in the United States that Nigeria exploded on to the global football scene by reaching the last 16 on their World Cup debut, before winning gold at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. But the fifth-ranked side in Africa will not be able to add to that list of achievements when the United States hosts the tournament again next year, along with Mexico and Canada. BBC Sport Africa examines where it all went wrong for the Super Eagles and the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF). Nigeria failed to build on their perfect start against DR Congo after Frank Onyeka's early strike put them ahead, with Meschack Elia equalising just after half an hour. The Super Eagles barely threatened after talisman Osimhen was went off injured at half-time. In the penalty shootout, Fulham defender Calvin Bassey scooped his effort over the bar for Nigeria before Moses Simon and Hull City centre-back Semi Ajayi had their spot-kicks saved. Nigeria coach Eric Chelle went as far as accusing a member of the DR Congo technical staff of \"voodoo\" while his side were taking penalties. While such allegations have previously been raised in the African game, they are now rare and one reporter in Rabat described the Malian's comments as \"surreal\". Just when it seemed Nigeria would be fully focused on the play-offs, their preparations were hit by off-field issues. After arriving in Morocco, Nigeriaplayers and technical staff boycotted trainingjust two days before their semi-final against Gabon in a dispute over unpaid allowances and match bonuses. Supporters saw it as symptomatic of deeper governance issues in the NFF, expressing anger at administrative failings and poor leadership which led to the boycott. The issue was resolved the following day, with centre-back William Troost-Ekong saying the side were \"united and focused on representing Nigeria with our maximum\". They did produce a strong performance tobeat Gabon 4-1 after extra timeon Thursday, but were unable to replicate that showing in Sunday's final. Victor Osimhen scored eight goals in seven World Cup qualifiers for Nigeria, who lacked a cutting edge without him Quite simply, Nigeria were not good enough over the course of the two-year qualification campaign. Changes in the dugout did not help matters, and statistics show an inability to perform without Osimhen leading the line, with just four points taken from a possible 15 when the Galatasaray striker was out injured. Nigeria were drawn alongside South Africa, Benin, Zimbabwe, Rwanda and Lesotho in Group C, and squeezed into the play-offs despite being top seeds. They drew 1-1 at home against Lesotho and played out a stalemate with Zimbabwe under manager Jose Peseiro in November 2023. The Portuguese then departed at the end of his contract in March 2024, despite guiding Nigeria to the final of the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon). Former Nigeria winger Finidi George took over, but his two matches as manager in June last year proved damaging to their hopes - a home draw against South Africa and a 2-1 defeat in Benin leaving the Super Eagles with just three points from four games. Finidi George, a star of Nigeria's 1994 World Cup squad, had a short-lived spell in charge of the Super Eagles during World Cup qualification The campaign paused as Augustine Eguavoen oversaw successful qualification for the 2025 Afcon, with Chelle thenappointed manager in Januaryand tasked with leading the Nigeria to the 2026 World Cup. He won four of his first six competitive games - though a last-minute equaliser at home to Zimbabwe in March was a setback and Nigeria showed scant ambition as they settled for a 1-1 draw in South Africa in October. The campaign did go down to the wire, but South Africa secured automatic qualification and Nigeria only booked their play-off spot when Onyeka scored in the 91st minute of their 4-0 win against Benin. Nigeria fans have been lamenting their exit on social media, decrying disjointed performances on the pitch and the failings of the NFF off it. Given many Nigeria players are developed at academies in Europe, a lack of investment in local facilities has been highlighted. \"The way Nigeria runs its football is a metaphor for Nigeria's internal governance as a whole,\" journalist David Hundeyin wrote on X. \"It has achieved an outrageous amount of success relative to the actual work it has put in, and success without work has now become a national expectation.\" The rest of Africa, meanwhile, has revelled in Nigeria's misery - not least those aligned to West African rivals Ghana, who beat Nigeria in a play-off for Qatar 2022 and also qualified for the 2026 finals. Eric Chelle joined Nigeria after spending two years in charge of Mali With just 36 days until their 2025 Africa Cup of Nations campaign kicks off against Tanzania on 23 December, the Super Eagles must quickly refocus. \"It's a wake-up call\", Abiodun Ogunjimi, a member of the Nigeria Football Supporters Club, told BBC Sport Africa. \"Hopefully Nigeria will come out of this. We'll go back to the drawing board and fix our problems.\" The NFF will likely assess Chelle's position, given delivering a place at the World Cup was the main target in his contract. The 48-year-old will be under more scrutiny given he was the first non-Nigerian African man to be placed in charge of the Super Eagles, though he had started to build a more cohesive side with an identity in recent games. Whether another managerial change is constructive in the short term remains to be seen, but the NFF must produce a blueprint for the nation to return to the World Cup finals in 2030.

One suspect had already been convicted in absentia of acts of sabotage in Ukraine, Tusk told parliament. On Monday, he visited the scene of an explosion near Mika, south-east of Warsaw, which damaged the railway line leading to the Ukrainian border at the weekend, and called it an \"unprecedented act of sabotage\". Another incident down the line near Pulawy on Monday forced a packed train to stop suddenly and damage was found to overhead cables. The Kremlin brushed off suggestions of Russian involvement. Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said: \"It would have been really strange, if Russia hadn't been blamed first.\" \"Russia is accused of all acts of hybrid and direct war... in Poland,\" he told Russia's state-run media, adding: \"Russophobia is certainly rampant there.\" Polish authorities had initially said there was a very high chance that the two acts of sabotage on the Warsaw-Lublin railway line had been ordered by a \"foreign service\". Then a spokesman for Poland's special services minister said on Tuesday that \"everything points to them being Russian special services\". \"The goal was to cause a rail catastrophe,\" Tusk told MPs. The Polish prime minister said he would not disclose the names of the two suspects as this could complicate the operation, though he told parliament that one was living in Belarus and the other was a resident of eastern Ukraine. Both suspects had crossed into Poland from Belarus during the autumn and had now returned there via the border crossing at Terespol in the far south-west of Belarus, close to the Ukrainian border, he added. Tusk said that a military-grade C4 explosive device had been detonated on 15 November at about 21:00 (20:00 GMT) near the village of Mika. The explosion, which happened as a freight train was passing, caused minor damage to a wagon floor. It was captured on CCTV. Tusk said the train driver had not even noticed the incident. A previous attempt to derail a train by placing a steel clamp on the rail had failed, he added. The second act of sabotage, on 17 November, involved a train carrying 475 passengers having to suddenly brake because of damaged railway infrastructure, said Tusk. The prime minister also said he would issue an order later on Tuesday to raise the alert level on certain railway lines. He said since the start of last year 55 people had been detained on suspicion of assisting, preparing, or committing acts of sabotage and that 23 of them had been remanded in custody. Russia's motivation, Tusk went on, was to sow panic and stir up anti-Ukrainian sentiment in Polish society, which is home to more than one million Ukrainian war refugees. \"I want to emphasise that what the Russian authorities care about is not only the direct effect of this type of action, but also the social and political consequences of the fact that this action is taking place,\" he said. \"This of course means disorganisation, chaos, panic, speculation and uncertainty.\" Poland is both a Nato and EU member state, and its railway network has become vital for moving supplies of aid into Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. In September,Tusk said three Russian drones had been shot down by Polish and other Nato aircraft in Poland's airspaceduring overnight attacks on Ukraine. He said at the time that authorities had recorded 19 drone incursions, with some flying deep enough to temporarily close four airports, including Warsaw's main hub Chopin. Russia's defence ministry responded by saying there had been \"no plans\" to target facilities on Polish soil."}

The much-anticipated sequel, released on Friday, sees Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande reprise their roles as Elphaba and Glinda in the origin story of the Wicked Witch of the West. Wicked: For Good is \"not quite Wicked: For Great\",said Empire's John Nugentin a three-star review. Total Film's Molly Edwardspraised the film as an \"absolute triumph\", but added it \"suffers slightly from thinner source material and weak new songs\". The Wizard of Oz spin-off, adapted from the hugely successful stage musical, is originally based on a 1995 book by Gregory Maguire. The second film provides fresh origin stories for Dorothy's travel companions in Oz - the Cowardly Lion, Scarecrow and Tin Man. Wicked: For Good also sees Jeff Goldblum return as the Wizard, alongside Michelle Yeoh as Madame Morrible and Jonathan Bailey as Fiyero. The i paper's Francesca Steele said:\"It doesn't quite reach the heights of Part One, but this is still a highly entertaining display of what musical theatre can do on screen with top level performances and a true affection for the world-building.\" Many critics were less enthusiastic. \"There's no magic in this aimless slog of a sequel,\"said the Independent's Clarisse Loughreyin a two-star review. \"If your complaint about last year's Wicked was that it was so oddly lit that you could barely see what was going on, then fear not – in Wicked: For Good, you won't mind so much, because there's so little to look at.\" In a one-star review,the Telegraph's Robbie Collin said:\"It doesn't amount to two hours of story – the stage show clips through the same plot in around half the time – and the padding is as obvious as it is exhausting.\" He suggested the central pair's friendship \"rings false\", adding: \"What should be piercing, impassioned moments are by turns frivolous and sappy.\" However,Kevin Maher of the Times wasmuch more positive, awarding the film four stars. \"They've only gone and done it,\" he said. \"The makers of this musical sequel have delivered a film that surpasses last year's box-office smash in verve, ambition and emotional ache.\" Both movies have been directed by Jon M Chu, who was also behind Crazy Rich Asians, In The Heights and Now You See Me 2. Chu is also set to direct a new big-screen adaptation of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, pencilled in for release in 2027. Many critics highlighted Grande's performance in Wicked: For Good, with several predicting another supporting actress nomination at the Oscars in March. Variety's Peter Debruge saidthe pop star shows \"fragility\" in her more \"nuanced\" performance. \"Whereas Grande had a relatively one-dimensional role to play in part one, Glinda now faces a complex evolution,\" he said. \"Grande has been acting since she was a kid,\"noted the Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney,\"and her quiet moments of introspection, anxiety or sadness show tender depths, as does her loyalty to Elphaba.\" But he also praised her co-star. \"Make no mistake, Erivo remains a powerhouse, with pipes that shake the heavens and a wellspring of unforced emotional intensity that never runs dry.\" \"What a performance from Erivo,\"agreed the Guardian's Peter Bradshawin a four-star review. He added the sequel as a whole \"keeps the rainbow-coloured dreaminess and the Broadway show tune zinginess from part one\". The stage musical was split into two parts for its film adaptation, but the two movies were filmed in one go. The first was released last November and grossed more than £750m at the box office worldwide. It went on to win two Oscars and two Baftas, for costume and production design, as well as the cinematic and box office achievement prize at the Golden Globes. One problem facing the sequel is that most of Wicked's best-known songs, including Popular and The Wizard and I, appeared in the first film. It's an issue it shares with the Broadway and West End musical. \"On stage, the second act lacks a song as strong as Defying Gravity,\" Debruge noted. In his Empire review of Wicked: For Good, Nugent concluded: \"The tone is different from that of the first film: less peppy, more glum. \"With the exception of Goldblum - who appears to be acting in his own film, delighting in stuttery drollness - all the characters are much less cheerful than they were last time around, and as a result it's less enjoyable for us to watch.\""}

The updated travel guidance includes Bangladesh, India, Iran, Jordan, Libya, Malawi, Malaysia, Morocco, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, and Rwanda following \"a global increase in the number of reported cases\" of methanol poisoning. Last month, Ecuador, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru, Russia and Uganda were added to the existing list, following a number of high-profile incidents includingthe death of six tourists in Laos in 2024. Travellers are being warned that even small amounts of methanol can cause blindness or death within 12 to 48 hours. Methanol is a toxic industrial alcohol used in antifreeze, windscreen washer fluid and paint thinner. It is not meant for human consumption. While it is naturally produced during the manufacture of alcoholic drinks, commercial firms reduce it to low, safe levels for human consumption through the distillation process. But in some countries, it is illegally mixed into alcoholic drinks to cut costs, and because it is tasteless and odourless, it is impossible to detect. The Foreign Office is running a campaign toadvise on reducing risks and recognising symptoms of methanol poisoning. Foreign Office minister Hamish Falconer said all travellers should know the signs of methanol poisoning. \"If you're drinking spirits overseas, stick to trusted places and avoid homemade alcohol or free shots,\" Falconer said. \"If something feels off, like a hangover that's way worse than normal or vision problems - get medical help fast.\" The full list of countries listed as posing a risk of methanol poisoning are: Brazil, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Iran, Japan, Jordan, Kenya, Laos, Libya, Malawi, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, Nepal, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Russia, Rwanda, Thailand, Turkey, Uganda, and Vietnam."}

Speaking exclusively to BBC News, Sundar Pichai said while the growth of artificial intelligence (AI) investment had been an \"extraordinary moment\", there was some \"irrationality\" in the current AI boom. It comes amid fears in Silicon Valley and beyond of a bubble as the value of AI tech companies has soared in recent months and companies spend big on the burgeoning industry. Asked whether Google would be immune to the impact of the AI bubble bursting, Mr Pichai said the tech giant could weather that potential storm, but also issued a warning. \"I think no company is going to be immune, including us,\" he said. In a wide-ranging exclusive interview at Google's California headquarters, he also addressed energy needs, slowing down climate targets, UK investment,the accuracy of his AI models, and the effect of the AI revolution on jobs. The interview comes as scrutiny on the state of the AI market has never been more intense. Alphabet shares have doubled in value in seven months to $3.5tn (£2.7tn) as markets have grown more confident in the search giant's ability to fend off the threat from ChatGPT owner OpenAI. A particular focus is Alphabet's development of specialised superchips for AI that compete with Nvidia, run by Jensen Huang, which recently reached a world first $5tn valuation. As valuations rise, some analysts have expressed scepticism about a complicated web of $1.4tn of deals being done around OpenAI, which is expected to have revenues this year of less than one thousandth of the planned investment. It has raised fears stock markets are heading for a repeat of the dotcom boom and bust of the late 1990s. This saw the values of early internet companies surge amid a wave of optimism for what was then a new technology, before the bubble burst in early 2000 and many share prices collapsed. This led to some companies going bust, resulting in job losses. A drop in share prices can also hit the value of people's savings including their pension funds. In comments echoing those made by US Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan in 1996, warning of \"irrational exuberance\" in the market well ahead of the dotcom crash, Mr Pichai said the industry can \"overshoot\" in investment cycles like this. \"We can look back at the internet right now. There was clearly a lot of excess investment, but none of us would question whether the internet was profound,\" he said. \"I expect AI to be the same. So I think it's both rational and there are elements of irrationality through a moment like this.\" His comments follow a warning from Jamie Dimon, the boss of US bank JP Morgan, who told the BBC last month that investment in AI would pay off, but some of the money poured into the industrywould \"probably be lost\". But Mr Pichai said Google's unique model of owning its own \"full stack\" of technologies - from chips to YouTube data, to models and frontier science - meant it was in a better position to ride out any AI market turbulence. The tech giant is also expanding its footprint in the UK. In September, Alphabet announced it wasinvesting in UK artificial intelligence, committing £5bn to infrastructure and research over the next two years. Mr Pichai said Alphabet will develop \"state of the art\" research work in the UK including at its key AI unit DeepMind, based in London. For the first time, he said Google would \"over time\" take a step that is being pushed for in government to \"train our models\" in the UK - a move that cabinet ministers believe would cement the UK as the number three AI \"superpower\" after the US and China. \"We are committed to investing in the UK in a pretty significant way,\" Mr Pichai said. However, he also warned about the \"immense\" energy needs of AI, which made up1.5% of the world's electricity consumption last year, according to the International Energy Agency. Mr Pichai said action was needed, including in the UK, to develop new sources of energy and scale up energy infrastructure. \"You don't want to constrain an economy based on energy, and I think that will have consequences,\" he said. He also acknowledged that the intensive energy needs of its expanding AI venture meant there was slippage on the company's climate targets, but insisted Alphabet still had a target of achieving net zero by 2030 by investing in new energy technologies. \"The rate at which we were hoping to make progress will be impacted,\" he said. AI will also affect work as we know it, Mr Pichai said, calling it \"the most profound technology\" humankind had worked on. \"We will have to work through societal disruptions,\" he said, adding that it would also \"create new opportunities\". \"It will evolve and transition certain jobs, and people will need to adapt,\" he said. Those who do adapt to AI \"will do better\". \"It doesn't matter whether you want to be a teacher [or] a doctor. All those professions will be around, but the people who will do well in each of those professions are people who learn how to use these tools.\" Sign up for our Tech Decoded newsletterto follow the world's top tech stories and trends.Outside the UK?

The remains of the Syrian woman and child, who had been missing for several months, were discovered on Friday. The freezers were hidden behind a drywall partition in the flat, located in the city of Innsbruck. Two men, a 55-year-old Austrian and his 53-year-old brother, were arrested in June. The older man, a colleague of the Syrian woman, told police last week there had been an accident - but denied murder. Speaking to reporters earlier, Hansjörg Mayr, a spokesman for the public prosecutor's office, said the pair were being held on \"strong suspicion of murder\". The names of those involved have not been released by police, in accordance with Austrian law. The family's disappearance was first reported by the woman's cousin, who lives in Germany, on 25 July 2024. Police said the woman's colleague - the 55-year-old man - told them at the time she had gone on an extended trip with her child to visit her parents in Turkey. Her bank card was then found to have been used abroad several times. But when police searched the woman's home, her mobile phone was found. A witness also reported hearing a loud noise in the apartment, and cries of \"mama\", on the day the two were thought to have disappeared. A wider police investigation was launched, with officers discovering various messages sent from the woman's phone - including a resignation letter to her employer and messages to the male colleague. Authorities said a four-figure sum was also transferred to the man. Katja Tersch, head of the State Criminal Police Office in Tyrol, told reporters on Tuesday that a storage unit had been rented out before the victims' disappearance and a freezer had been placed there. The brothers removed the freezer from the unit on the day the woman and her child disappeared, Tersch said. And a week later, they acquired another freezer. Authorities say they believe this suggests the deaths were premeditated. \"The cause of death could not be determined due to the state of decomposition of the bodies,\" Tersch said. Mayr - of the public prosecutor's office - said the exact sequence of events is not yet known, but the bodies were professionally hidden and not discovered during a previous house search. While the brothers were arrested in June,it was not until 12 November that the 55-year-old admitted to an incident and to hiding the bodies. He denies any intent to kill, authorities said. Meanwhile, his younger brother admitted to a cover-up but denied knowledge of a homicide. The pair are currently in pre-trial detention in prisons in Innsbruck and Salzburg, around 117 miles (189km) apart. In a joint statement, Austria's Minister for Women Eva-Maria Holzleitner and Justice Minister Anna Sporrer said the \"alleged double murder... represents the sudden and brutal end of two human lives and exposes a cruel system\". \"Women and girls are being murdered due to the mere fact that they are women and girls,\" they continued. \"Femicides are a deeply rooted and society-wide problem that we must fight resolutely.\""}

National Grid said the construction of Weston Marsh substations A and B, near Spalding, was \"vital\" for the future of the UK's energy supply. The proposals are part of the 87-mile (140km) Grimsby to Walpole pylon plan, which has drawn objections from Lincolnshire County Council and communities along the route. Jenny Pennington, who lives close to the proposed substation site, said she was concerned about what her family could soon be living near to and that it was \"not good news for the area\". She said: \"We're not sure of the size of the substations yet. Obviously, we'll have to wait and see. \"I won't say it's a shock because we knew it was coming but it's not good news for the area, it's going to make Weston [Marsh] a very industrial area.\" Ben Ridgeon, from National Grid, said it was \"important\" the company listened to local views. He said: \"The substations are a vital part of the infrastructure needed to connect new sources of homegrown energy, helping to secure Lincolnshire's energy supply and supporting investment and growth in the region.\" National Grid said the two substations would be connected by a \"short\" underground cable and linked to the proposed Grimsby to Walpole pylon network. There will also be a connection to an electricity cable coming ashore from the Outer Dowsing Offshore Windfarm. In a statement, the company added: \"Electricity demand in the UK, and in Lincolnshire, is expected to double by 2050 and the existing network cannot accommodate the growth.\" The proposals for Weston Marsh A and B will mean there are now nine large substations currently planned for Lincolnshire. According to National Grid, the substation sites will each cover an area the size of at least 10 football pitches and be up to 15m (49ft) in height.

A new six-part series, written by creator Jed Mercurio, will begin filming in Belfast in the spring, the BBC confirmed. McClure said she was \"so excited\" the series was returning, with Dunbar adding: \"What a joy it is to know that the Three Amigos will be back filming together next year.\" The last series concluded in 2021 with a finale that attracted more than 17 million viewers. Speculation about a return has been rife ever since, but Mercurio and the BBC have not confirmed it until now. The BBC has not yet announced when the new season will hit screens. The finale of series six drew the show's long-running storyline about the hunt for criminal mastermind known as \"H\" to a close, and the BBC and creative team behind the show said at the time there were no plans for any further series. However, the corporation confirmed on Tuesday that a seventh series is now in development. Series seven will open with AC-12 having been disbanded and rebranded the Inspectorate of Police Standards, the BBC confirmed. Steve Arnott (Compston), Kate Fleming (McClure) and Ted Hastings (Dunbar) are still working to tackle corruption in the police force. The BBC said their line of work \"has never been more difficult, and, in this challenging climate, [the trio] are assigned their most sensitive case so far\". A new character, Det Insp Dominic Gough, a charismatic officer celebrated for a string of takedowns of organised crime, is accused of abusing his position to act as a sexual predator. But his case could be a deliberate distraction from a bigger threat still operating in the shadows, the announcement teased. In a statement, Mercurio said: \"Everyone involved in Line of Duty feels enormous gratitude to the show's fans. \"We're privileged to have had so many of you follow the ups and downs of AC-12 over six previous seasons and we couldn't be more delighted to be returning for a seventh.\" He added: \"Corruption in this country is supposed to have come to an end while Line of Duty was off air so I've been forced to use my imagination.\" Line of Duty launched in 2012 and went on to become one of the most popular TV drams of the last decade, attracting guest stars such as Stephen Graham, Thandiwe Newton, Kelly Macdonald and Lennie James. Compston described appearing in the police drama as \"a job of a lifetime\". \"Not only in terms of the show's success but the people I've had the opportunity to work with I now call some of my closest friends. \"I can't wait to pull the waistcoat on again and get the team back together,\" he said.

The southern African kingdom, led by absolute monarch King Mswati III, has come in for heavy criticism from rights groups for striking the deportation deal with President Donald Trump's government. Questioned in parliament about the deal on Monday, Eswatini's Finance Minister Neal Rijkenberg confirmed the sum received from the US. \"We were told it was for the US deportees after we enquired,\" he said, adding the ministry had been kept in the dark throughout the process, AFP news agency reports. In September, campaign group Human Rights Watch (HRW) said it had seen the copy of an agreement, providing for Eswatini to accept up to 160 deportees from the US in exchange for $5.1m to build its \"border and migration management capacity\". Eswatini has so far accepted two batches of deportees - five in July and 10 in October. One of the deportees has since been repatriated to Jamaica, his country of origin. Eswatini government acting spokeswoman Thabile Mdluli told the BBC that \"engagements\" were ongoing to repatriate the other deportees to their countries of origin. \"Eventually, they will all be repatriated,\" she said. Rijkenberg told parliament the $5.1m received from the US was put into the account of Eswatini's National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA), AFP reports. However, the NDMA was not allowed to use the money as it had not been allocated to it by the government, and the payment still needed to regularised, the minister was quoted as saying. Although this was the first time the government confirmed receiving $5.1m, Ms Mdluli told the BBC that it had \"always been transparent\" about the fact that the US government was \"financing the welfare and repatriation costs\" of the deportees along with \"other expenses associated with their temporary stay in Eswatini\". Lawyers and civil society groups in Eswatini have instituted court action to challenge the legality of the government's decision to accept the deportees. The government is defending the court action, saying it had the power to reach the deal with the US. Ms Mdluli told the BBC that any decision to accept more deportees would depend on \"engagements\" with the US government and \"capacity availability\". Eswatini's prison department has previously said the deportees were being \"securely accommodated\", and posed no threat to the public. The US had described some of the deportees - from Jamaica, Cuba, Laos, Vietnam and Yemen - as \"depraved monsters\". The deal also alarmed neighbouring South Africa, which expressed fears that the deportees could cross into the country over their porous border. Previously known as Swaziland, Eswatini is a small, landlocked country surrounded by South Africa and Mozambique. It has been led by King Mswati III since 1986.

Known as cloud-seeding, the process was conducted over the Urmia lake basin on Saturday, Iran's official news agency Irna reported. Urmia is Iran's largest lake, but has largely dried out leaving a vast salt bed. Further operations will be carried out in east and west Azerbaijan, the agency said. Rainfall is at record lows and reservoirs are nearly empty. Last week President Masoud Pezeshkian warned that if there is not enough rainfall soon, Tehran's water supply could be rationed and people may be evacuated from the capital. Cloud seedinginvolves injecting chemical salts including silver or potassium iodide into clouds via aircraft or through generators on the ground. Water vapour can then condense more easily and turn into rain. The technique has been around for decades,and the UAE has used it in recent years to help address water shortages. Iran's meteorological organisation said rainfall had decreased by about 89% this year compared with the long-term average, Irna reported. \"We are currently experiencing the driest autumn the country has experienced in 50 years,\" it added. Officials have also announced plans to penalise households and businesses that consume excessive amounts of water. The head of Iran's National Centre for Climate and Drought Crisis Management, Ahmad Vazifeh said dams in Tehran, West Azerbaijan, East Azerbaijan and Markazi are in a \"worrying state\", with water levels in the single-digit percentages. On Friday, hundreds gathered at a mosque in Tehran to pray for rainfall. Iranian meteorologists reported there was some rainfall in the west and northwest of the country on Saturday - with video showing snowfall on a ski resort north of Tehran for the first time this year."}

Sir David, 50, was dressed in a grey three-piece suit made by his fashion designer wife, which was inspired by a suit King Charles wore when he was younger. The footballer said: \"[King Charles] was quite impressed with my suit. He's the most elegantly dressed man that I know, so he inspired quite a few of my looks over the years and he definitely inspired this look.\" \"It was something that my wife made me,\" he continued. \"I looked at old pictures of [King Charles] when he was quite young in morning suits and I was like 'OK, that's what I want to wear' - so I gave it to my wife and she did it.\" Speaking of his honour, Sir David said: \"I couldn't be prouder. People know how patriotic I am - I love my country. \"I've always said how important the monarchy is to my family. \"I'm lucky enough to have travelled around the world and all people want to talk to me about is our monarchy. It makes me proud.\" Lady Beckham received an OBE in 2017 for services to the fashion industry, while Sir David was appointed an officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2003. Sir David played 115 times for his country as well as for Manchester United, Real Madrid, LA Galaxy, Paris St-Germain and AC Milan, retiring in 2013. He also played a key role in securing the London 2012 Olympics, and has been an ambassador for Unicef since 2005.

Sir Kazuo, whose books include 1989's The Remains of the Day and 2005's Never Let Me Go, for which he won the Man Booker Prize, was made a Companion of Honour. Evita star Dame Elaine received her honour for services to music and charity. The 77-year-old wore a blue feathered hat made by a milliner to the late Queen and carried a bag designed by Lady Beckham. She told the BBC of her honour: \"To be given it for doing something you love doing and to have the privilege of being able to do, and be passionate about it, is a stroke of luck, I think.\" Speaking about her 60 years in showbusiness, she added: \"It never felt like an effort, it never felt like work, being my passion and privilege to be able to do something I love, it's never felt like effort, it's just been a joy for 60 years. \"I think to myself I'm so extraordinarily lucky to have had this wonderful life in theatre and music, I really am.

The Rodney Parade club's chairman David Wright and chief executive Rhys Blumberg left shortly after the start of discussions with the WRU at Principality Stadium on 6 November. Blumberg has since held talks with the Union as Dragons' representative at Professional Rugby Board (PRB) meetings. The WRU has proposed cutting one of the current four professional men's teams – Cardiff, Dragons, Ospreys, Scarlets – by 2027, and potentially by the start of next season. There is set to be one in the west, one in Cardiff and one in the east, but Dragons have major concerns over the Union's demand to take control of rugby matters and leave clubs with just the commercial responsibilities. \"At the Dragons there is no prospect of signing up to any structure that strips the club of control over what happens on the field,\" said chairman David Wright. Welsh rugby bosses plan to cut one side by 2027 What Welsh shake-up means and why it matters to rest of rugby world Scrum V Live to show festive Welsh derbies in URC The WRU announced plans to cut to three teams on 24 October after a consultation period on previous proposals to go down to as few as two. The governing body then held talks with all the professional clubs and Dragons state that they expected a \"constructive and meaningful\" engagement. \"Under the current WRU proposals professional clubs would have no control over rugby decisions including coaching, player recruitment and selection,\" read a club statement. \"For Dragons RFC this is not viable or desirable, but we have consistently sought a constructive discussion on how to improve the Union's plans.\" \"Shortly after the meeting started, it became clear and apparent that the WRU was not inclined to make amendments to their proposed governance arrangements. We therefore left the meeting soon after. \"In short, nothing had changed, the WRU was still insisting on controlling all rugby related matters and demanding that they directly employ all players, coaches and all support staff. \"Central management by the WRU of all rugby operations is not acceptable, nor is it in the interests of club owners, who expect to be fully responsible and accountable for rugby operations, a key and fundamental element of the club and business we bought.\" Dragons say they are also unhappy with \"a new set of financial commitments demanded from owners... which are both unacceptable and off-market\" that they had been unaware of prior to receiving documents from the WRU on 6 November. Dragons prop Chris Coleman made his Wales debut in Japan in 2025 Dragons were WRU-owned from 2017 until 2023 when then chairman David Buttress, Wright and Hoyoung Huh completed a takeover. The deal included the nine-acre Rodney Parade site, which is the only stadium suitable for top level professional sport in the east of Wales. \"Supporters understand instinctively that their team must be selected by their own club. They will not throw their heart behind a side assembled anywhere other than Rodney Parade,\" said Wright. \"We will go on pressing for a settlement that respects supporters, serves the club and strengthens the national game. \"The WRU must now pause, think again and reconsider both its position on governance and the financial terms it has placed on the table.\" Dragons endured a winless first block in the United Rugby Championship (URC) after failing to take late opportunities in home draws with Sharks and Ospreys. Filo Tiatia's side have not won in the URC since the opening weekend of last season and their last success was in the Challenge Cup at Newcastle last December. The Rodney Parade club have provided five members of the current Wales squad for the autumn internationals. Aaron Wainwright has faced Argentina and Japan but Ben Carter, Chris Coleman, Rio Dyer and the uncapped Brodie Coghlan are yet to feature."}

A walkway runs along the length of it, passing by a giant dinosaur skeleton, a beach volleyball pitch and dozens of Googlers lunching under the hazy November sun. But it's a laboratory, hidden away at the back of the campus behind some trees, that he is most excited to show me. This is where the invention that Google believes is its secret weapon is being developed. Known as a Tensor Processing Unit (or TPU), it looks like an unassuming little chip but, says Mr Pichai, it will one day power every AI query that goes through Google. This makes it potentially one of the most important objects in the world economy right now. \"AI is the most profound technology humanity [has ever worked] on,\" he insists. \"It has potential for extraordinary benefits - we will have to work through societal disruptions.\" But the confusing question lingering over the AI hype is whether it is a bubble at risk of bursting - as, if so, it may well be a spectacular burst akin to the dotcom crash at the start of the century, with consequences for us all. The Bank of England has already warned of a \"sudden correction\" in global financial markets, saying \"market valuations appear stretched\" for tech AI firms. Meanwhile. OpenAI boss Sam Altman has speculated that \"there are many parts of AI that I think are kind of bubbly right now\". Asked whetherGoogle would be immunefrom a potential bubble burst, Mr Pichai said it could weather that potential storm - but for all his starry-eyed excitement around the possibilities of AI, he also issued a warning: \"I think no company is going to be immune, including us.\" So why, then, is Google investing more than $90bn a year in the AI build-out, a three-fold increase in just four years, at the very moment these suggestions are being discussed? The AI surge - of which Google is just one part - is, in cash terms, the biggest market boom the world has seen. Its numbers are extraordinary - there is $15 trillion of market value at Google and four other tech giants whose headquarters are all within a short drive of one another. Chipmaker turned AI systems pioneer Nvidia in Santa Clara is now worth more than $5 trillion. A 10-minute drive south, in Cupertino, is Apple HQ, hovering around $4 trillion; while 15 minutes west is $1.9 trillion Meta (previously Facebook). And in the centre of San Francisco, OpenAI was recently valued at $500bn. The purely financial consequences of this trend are significant enough. The value of the shares in these companies (and a few others outside Silicon Valley, such as Microsoft in Seattle) have helped cushion the US economy from the impact of trade wars, and kept retirement plans and investments buoyant - and not just in the US. Yet it comes with a big risk. That is, the incredible dependence of US stock market growth on the performance of a handful of tech giants. The Magnificent 7 - Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla - collectively comprise one third of the valuation of America's entire S&P 500. And that market value is now more highly concentrated in a few firms than it was during the dotcom bubble in 1999, according to the IMF. Mr Pichai points out that every decade or so come these \"inflection points\": the personal computer, then the internet in the late 1990s, followed by mobile and cloud. \"Now it's clearly the era of Artificial Intelligence.\" But as for the big question - is it a bubble? Mr Pichai argues there are two ways of thinking about it. First, there is \"palpably exciting\" progress of services that people and companies are using. But he concedes: \"It's also true when we go through these investment cycles, there are moments we overshoot collectively as an industry… \"So I think it's both rational and there are elements of irrationality through a moment like this.\" Now, a distinction is emerging in the markets between those businesses that rely on often borrowed money and  complicated deals to access the chips that power their AI, and the biggest tech companies, such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon, which can fund investment in chips and data from their own pockets. Which brings us to Google's own silicon chips, or their prized TPUs. The lab, where they are tested, is the size of a five-a-side football pitch with a mesh of multi-coloured wires and deep blue blinking lights. Signs all around read: \"restricted\". What's striking is the sheer noise - this is down to the cooling systems, which are needed to help control the temperature of the chips, which can get incredibly hot when crunching trillions of calculations. The TPUs are designed to help power AI machines. And they work differently from other types of chips. The CPU (central processing unit) is the primary component of a computer - essentially its brain - that performs most of the processing and control functions, while GPUs (graphics processing units) perform more specialised processing, executing many parallel tasks at once - this can include AI. However Asics (application-specific integrated circuits), are chips custom-built for a specific purpose, for example, a specific AI algorithm. And the TPU is a specialist Google-designed type of Asic. A core aspect of the AI boom has been the mad dash to amass lots of top-performing chips and put them into data centres (or the physical facilities that store, process and run large amounts of data and software). Nvidia's boss Jensen Huang once coined the term \"AI factories\" to describe the massive data centres full of pods and racks of super chips, connected to huge energy and cooling systems. (Tech bosses such as Mark Zuckerberg have referred to some being the size of Manhattan. The Google TPU lab is somewhat more modest, testing out the technology for deployment elsewhere.) Stories abound of tech bros begging chip makers for hundreds of thousands of these highly engineered pieces of silicon. Take the recent dinner at Nobu in Palo Alto, where Elon Musk and Larry Ellison, the founder and head of Oracle, tried to woo Nvidia's Jensen Huang, to sell them more of them. As Mr Ellison put it: \"I would describe the dinner as me and Elon begging Jensen for GPUs. Please take our money - no, no take more. You're not taking enough. We need you to take more, please!\" It is precisely the race to access the power of as many as possible of these high performance chips, and to scale them up into massive data centres, that is driving an AI boom - and there's a perception that the only way to win is to keep spending. The terrace of the Rosewood Sand Hill hotel, a sprawling 16-acre estate near the Santa Cruz mountains that serves crab rolls and $35 signature vodka martinis, is where the big Silicon Valley deal-making gets done. It's close to Stanford University and Meta's HQ, as well as the headquarters of major venture capital firms. There are whispered rumours about who will be next to announce customised AI chips - Asics - to compete with Google and Nvidia. Just before I visited, something of a storm was brewing about the investment plans of OpenAI, which Elon Musk co-founded. The firm, which started as a not-for-profit but has since established a commercial structure, has been the focus of a web of cross-investments involving buying up chips and other computer hardware needed for AI processing. Few in the industry doubt OpenAI's phenomenal user growth - in particular the popularity of its chatbot, ChatGPT. It has ambitions to design its own custom AI chips, but some have speculated about whether it might need government support to achieve this. In a podcast episode that aired last month, an OpenAI investor questioned how the company's spending commitments tallied with its revenues, to which co-founder Sam Altman shot back, challenging the revenue figures quoted, and adding: \"If you want to sell your shares, I'll find you a buyer. Enough.\" He has since shared a lengthy post on X, explaining, among other things, that OpenAI is looking at commitments of about $1.4 trillion over the next eight years and why he believes now is the time to invest in scaling up their technology. \"I do not think the government should be writing insurance policies for AI companies,\" he said. But he also said: \"What we do think might make sense is governments building (and owning) their own AI infrastructure.\" Elsewhere, there have been notable very recent falls in share prices of AI infrastructure companies - Coreweave, a start-up that supplies OpenAI, saw its shares lose 26% of their value earlier this month. Plus, there have been some reactions in markets for perceived credit risk among other firms. And while most of these tech share prices have generally climbed higher over the course of 2025, there has been a mild dip more generally in the past few days. None of this has dampened the excitement over AI's potential within the industry. Google's consumer AI model, Gemini 3.0, launched to great fanfare earlier this week — this will pitch Google in a direct battle with OpenAI and its still-dominant ChatGPT for the market share. What we don't yet know is whether it marks an end to the days of chatbots going rogue and recommending glue as a pizza ingredient. So, is the end result of all this fantastic investment is that information is less reliable, I asked Mr Pichai. \"I think if you only construct systems standalone and you only rely on that, [that] would be true,\" he told me. \"Which is why I think we have to make the information ecosystem has to be much richer than just having AI technology being the sole product in it.\" But I put it to him that truth matters. His response: \"truth matters\". Nor is the other big question facing tech today dampening the enthusiasm around advancing AI's potential. That is: how on Earth to power it? By 2030, data centres around the world will use about as much electricity as India did in 2023, according to the IMF. Yet this is also an age where energy supply is under pressure by governments committing to climate change targets. I put this to Google's Mr Pichai, asking if it is coherent to have ambitions to generate 95% of electricity from low-carbon sources by 2030 - as the UK government does - and also be an AI superpower? \"I think it's possible. But I think for every government, including the UK, it's important to figure out how to scale up infrastructure, including energy infrastructure. \"You don't want to constrain an economy based on energy,\" he adds. \"I think that will have consequences.\" Years ago, as a fledgling reporter I cut my teeth in the 2000 dotcom bubble. It followed a famous speech by Federal Reserve Governor Alan Greenspan about \"irrational exuberance\". In that time I interviewed Steve Jobs twice, and a few years later questioned Mr Pichai's predecessor Larry Page, and commentated live on the collapse of WorldOfFruit.com. Through it all, one lesson became clear: that even in the worst-case scenarios and the toughest of crashes, catastrophe isn't guaranteed for all. Take Amazon - its share price slumped to $6 and its market capitalisation fell to $4bn during that crash, yet some 25 years on Jeff Bezos and his company are very much going strong. Today Amazon is worth $2.4 trillion. The same would, inevitably, be true of companies shaken by a potential AI bubble burst. Plus there is another looming factor that may well explain why so many in Silicon Valley - and beyond - are blind to, or perhaps choosing not to, acknowledge this risk, and pushing on regardless. That is, the attraction of the glittering prize at the end: achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI). This is the point at which machines match human intelligence, something many believe is within reach. Or beyond that, reaching artificial super-intelligence (ASI), the point at which machines surpass our intelligence. But I was also told something else that was thought-provoking by a Silicon Valley figure - that it doesn't matter whether there really is a bubble or if it bursts. Step back and what is going on in the bigger picture is a global battle for AI supremacy, with the US against China taking centre stage. And while Beijing funds these developments centrally, in the US it is a messy but productive free market free for all, which means trial and error on an epic scale. For now, the US has superiority in silicon over China - companies like Nvidia with their GPUs and Google with their TPUs can afford to accelerate into the storm. Others will surely fail, and spectacularly so, affecting markets, consumer sentiment and the world economy. The physical footprint left behind, however, containing sheer computing firepower for the deployment of mass AI technologies, will inevitably shape our economy and could well also shape how we work and learn - and who dominates the world for the rest of the 21st Century.

Lebanese-French musician Omar Harfouch, who announced his resignation from the eight-member jury on Instagram, alleged that an \"impromptu jury\" had pre-selected finalists ahead of the competition, set to be held on Friday in Thailand. Hours later, French football manager Claude Makélélé also announced he'd pulled out, citing \"unforeseen personal reasons\". The resignations come two weeks after several Miss Universecontestants walked outof a pre-pageant event over controversial comments made by an official from host nation Thailand. \"An impromptu jury has been formed to select 30 finalists from among the 136 participating countries, without the presence of any of the real [eight] members of the jury, including me,\" Mr Harfouch wrote in an Instagram post on Tuesday, saying he had discovered this via social media. The unofficial jury comprises \"individuals with a significant potential conflict of interest due to some personal relationships with some of the Miss Universe contestants\", he claimed. Mr Harfouch did not elaborate on how this \"impromptu jury\" would function, or how it would override the official jury's decision. The Miss Universe Organisation on Tuesday put out a statement to rebuff Mr Harfouch's claims, saying that \"no external group has been authorised to evaluate delegates or select finalists\". It suggested thatMr Harfouch may have been referring to the Beyond the Crown programme: a \"social impact initiative\" that operates independently from the Miss Universe competition, and has a separate selection committee. The Miss Universe Organisation announced the Beyond the Crown selection committee on Monday. In its statement on Tuesday, the organisation said that Mr Harfouch's allegations had \"mischaracterised\" the programme. Mr Makélélé, who also announced his resignation via Instagram, described it as a \"difficult decision\". \"I hold Miss Universe in the highest regard. The platform represents empowerment, diversity, and excellence - values I have always championed throughout my career,\" he wrote. The beauty pageant drew backlash earlier this month after its Thailand director Nawat Itsaragrisil publicly berated Miss Mexico, Fatima Bosch, at a pre-pageant event for not posting promotional content on her social media platforms. In videos that have since gone viral, Ms Bosch and several other contestants could be seen walking out of the event, and some could be heard shouting at Mr Nawat. Mr Nawat later claimed that some of his words were misunderstood - but his conduct nevertheless prompted a stern rebuke from the Miss Universe Organisation, which has since sent a delegation of international executives to take over running the competition."}

Special envoy Steve Witkoff was rumoured to take part in the talks, but hours before the meeting was meant to take place his attendance had not been confirmed. Turkey has maintained ties with both Kyiv and Moscow and has previously hosted talks between the two factions. But no Russian representative is set to join the meeting in Ankara, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday. He added that while there were \"no concrete plans\" for Vladimir Putin to speak to either the Turkish side or to US special envoy Steve Witkoff, the Russian president was \"of course open to a conversation\". Ankara will be the fourth capital Zelensky visits in only a few days. In Athens he secured a gas deal, in Paris he signed an agreement to obtain up to 100 fighter jets and in Madrid he held talks on co-operation with Spanish arms manufacturers. The visits are part of Zelensky's mission to try to shore up European support for Ukraine while Russian attacks on the country intensify and Moscow's troops close in on the key city eastern city of Pokrovsk. Domestically, Zelensky isfacing the most serious crisis in years. Several members of his closest circle are under investigation for co-organising a large-scale criminal scheme, and two ministers have resigned. The scandal threatens to widen still and some EU leaders – who in December will decide whether to unblocka €140bn (£121bn) loan for Kyiv based on frozen Russian state assets– have warned Zelensky needs to do more to tackle corruption. As the fourth anniversary of the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022 inches closer, Moscow and Kyiv remain fundamentally opposed in their views of how to end the war. Earlier in November Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Russia's conditions for a peace deal had not changed since Putin laid them out in 2024. At the time, the Russian president demanded that Kyiv renounce any ambition to join Nato, as well as full Ukrainian withdrawal from the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions. Zelensky has repeatedly argued that withdrawing from Donetsk and Luhansk – together known as the Donbas – would leave the rest of the country vulnerable to future attacks. Following a long meeting with Putin in April, Witkoff - the US special envoy - appeared to suggest that a peace deal between Moscow and Kyiv hinged on the status of the contested Ukrainian regions as well as Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014. This stance led to tensions with Zelensky, who accused him of \"disseminating Russian narratives\". Zelensky and Witkoff have not met since early September. Although the summer saw a flurry of high-level talks and meetings - including between Trump and Putin - American efforts to bring a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine closer have stalled. At one point, it appeared Trump and Putin were about to meet again in Budapest –but that summit was scrapped, apparently after the US side became aware that Moscow had no intention of budging from several demands that were unacceptable to Kyiv. But contact between US and Russian officials has continued, albeit under the radar. Putin's special envoy Kirill Dmitriev was reportedly in Washington for meetings with Witkoff in late October, only days afterTrump imposed sanctions on Russia's two biggest oil companies."}

Amine Kessaci, 22, was writing inLe Monde newspapera day after the funeral of his younger brother Mehdi, whose murder last week has been described by the government as a turning-point in France's drugs wars. \"Yesterday I lost my brother. Today I speak out,\" he wrote in his opinion piece. \"[The drugs-traffickers] strike at us in order to break, to tame, to subdue. They want to wipe out any resistance, to break any free spirit, to kill in the egg any embryo of revolt.\" Mehdi Kessaci, 20, was shot dead last Wednesday as he parked his car in central Marseille in what appears to have been a warning or punishment aimed at his older brother, Amine, from the city's drugs gangs. Speaking after a ministerial meeting on drugs crime at the Elysée palace on Tuesday, Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez said: \"We all agreed that this premeditated murder was something totally new. It's clearly a crime of intimidation. It's a new level of violence.\" Mehdi was the second Kessaci brother to be killed by drugs criminals. In 2020 the body of Brahim Kessaci, then 22, was found in a burnt-out car. That murder prompted Amine to launch his association, Conscience, which aims to expose the damage to working-class communities caused by gangs. Marseille is renowned for worsening drugs wars, and Amine Kessaci recently wrote a book called Marseille Wipe your Tears – Life and Death in a Land of Drugs. In his Le Monde article, Amine revealed he was recently warned by police to leave Marseille because of threats to his life. He attended his younger brother's funeral wearing a bullet-proof jacket and under heavy police protection. \"I speak because I have no choice but to fight if I don't want to die. I speak because I know that silence is the refuge of our enemies,\" he wrote, urging courage from citizens, and action from the government. Mehdi Kessaci's murder has brought the national spotlight back on a drugs trafficking problem that French experts and ministers agree is reaching almost unmanageable proportions. According to Senate member Étienne Blanc, author of a recent study, turnover in the drugs trade in France is now €7bn (£6bn) – or 70% of the entire budget of the justice ministry. He said around 250,000 people drew a living from the trade in France – more than the entire number of police and gendarmes, which is 230,000. According to Le Monde, the country counts 1.1 million users of cocaine. President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday launched a broadside against such consumers, telling the weekly cabinet meeting that \"sometimes it is the city-centre bourgeoisie that is funding the traffickers\". Macron had called a special drugs summit the day before in response to Amine's murder and in order to review progress on a new anti-drugs law that was passed in June. It sets up a special prosecutor's office dedicated to organised crime - similar to the office that tackles terrorism - which will eventually have 30 specialised magistrates. Under the law, senior drugs convicts are made to serve their terms in isolation in a specially converted prison where it is hoped it will be harder to continue running operations from behind bars. According to Laurent Nuñez, there is evidence that the crackdown on drugs crime is having an effect - with the number of homicides in Marseille down from 49 in 2023 to 24 in 2024. The number of dealing points in the city had halved from 160 to 80, he added. \"The war is not won, but we do have results.\" According to the author of a recent book, Narcotraffic, Europe's poison,\"France is at the heart of the geopolitics of drugs. With its two major ports of Marseille and Le Havre, it has an ideal geographical position in this Europe of free movement.\" Mathieu Verboud said that the growth in world production of cocaine had triggered an \"explosion of supply and demand. The market has gone through the roof and so have the profits.\" The sheer wealth of drugs organisations meant they had the power to corrupt everyone from dock-workers to local politicians, the author warned, a process he said was already well-advanced in countries like the Netherlands and Belgium. Several French politicians have said it is time to call in the army to deal with drugs-trafficking and the gangs which hold sway in many high-immigration city estates. Christian Estrosi, mayor of the southern coastal city of Nice, said: \"Narcotrafficking has transformed into narcoterrorism. Its aim now is to terrorise, subjugate and rule. \"We have already successfully deployed the means to fight terrorism. It's time to act with determination against narcoterrorism.\" Estrosi was referring to wave of deadly jihadist attacks in the mid 2010s, when France deployed hundreds of soldiers on to the streets of many cities where they continue to patrol."}

The Rolling Stones frontman visited The Mick Jagger Centre at Dartford Grammar School in Kent on Wednesday to mark the 25th anniversary of the facility. The 82-year-old thanked music teachers at the performing arts centre who \"inspired children and young people in their musical careers\". Sir Mick told the BBC that young people aiming for a career in music needed \"a lot of luck\" and to \"work really hard at it and not give up\". He said that \"music wasn't much of a career\" when he was growing up, but added: \"That all changed very, very quickly in the early 60s and I got on that bandwagon.\" He opened The Mick Jagger Centre, home to the Dartford Music School and Dartford Symphony Orchestra, in 2000. The centre launched a programme of events in October to mark its 25th anniversary. Sir Mick said that visiting his former school \"brings back a lot of memories and it's nice to see the kids seem happy\". According to The Mick Jagger Centre, the singer funds its Red Rooster project offering music tuition, including in local primary schools. \"If you can express yourself through song, drama, art, dance – all these things are important,\" Sir Mick added. \"My involvement's been honestly pretty minimal in a real way, but I do feel connected to it, and I think all the people involved with it have done a really wonderful job.\" The school's headmaster, Julian Metcalf, said the return visit from Sir Mick was \"very special and the icing on the cake\". Sir Mick first met The Rolling Stones bandmate Keith Richards on a platform at Dartford station, forming a friendship that would lead to the band's formation in 1962. The town has several streets named after The Rolling Stones songs, including Little Red Walk, Angie Mews and Ruby Tuesday Drive. Follow BBC Kent onFacebook, onX, and onInstagram.

BBC journalists saw United Nations security staff running behind a line of Brazilian soldiers shouting at delegates to immediately leave the venue. The UN told BBC News that the incident caused minor injuries to two security staff, in addition to limited damage to the venue. Social media videos showed protesters that appeared to be from indigenous groups and others waving flags with the logo of a left-wing Brazilian youth movement called Juntos. Protesters, some wearing what appeared to be traditional indigenous dress, stormed the COP30 entrance, chanting and kicking down doors, before tussling with security personnel, videos posted online showed. Demonstrators crossed the first security barriers of the venue and were then prevented from getting further in, the UN told the BBC. A security guard said he was hit in the head by a drum thrown by a protester, according to the Reuters news agency. It is a highly unusual security breach at a conference that has strict protocols. Brazilian and UN authorities are investigating the incident, according to the UN. Delegates from almost 200 countries are attending COP30 talks, which officially runs from Monday 10 November to Friday 21 November. This year's gathering takes place ten years after the Paris climate agreement, in which countries pledged to try to restrict the rise in global temperatures to 1.5C. It is the first time the conference is being held in Brazil, with the talks taking place in Belém on the edge of the Amazon rainforest. The location has proved a controversial decision for a number of reasons, in part due to the Amazon's residents, many of whom are vocal critics of the environmental damage caused to their home by climate change and deforestation. Brazil has also continued togrant new licences for oil and gaswhich, alongside coal, are fossil fuels, the main cause of global warming. An indigenous leader from the Tupinamba community told Reuters, \"we can't eat money,\" and that they were upset about development in the rainforest. \"We want our lands free from agribusiness, oil exploration, illegal miners and illegal loggers,\" he said. The meetings this year have been dubbed \"the Indigenous peoples COP\", with Brazilian organisers promising to put indigenous people at the centre of the talks. Brazil's Minister of Indigenous Peoples Sonia Guajajara hailed COP30 as \"historic\" event, and estimated that 3,000 Indigenous peoples from around the world would be in attendance. A UN report released earlier this year said that Indigenous people safeguard 80% of the planet's remaining biodiversity – yet receive less than one per cent of international climate funding. Indigenous peoples are disproportionately impacted by climate change due to their dependence on the natural environment and its resources. Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silvatold the opening of the summit that the world must \"defeat\" climate denialismand fight fake news. He said that the decision to hold COP30 in Belém was designed to show that the Amazon is an essential part of the climate solution, adding that \"COP30 will be the COP of truth\" in an era of \"misrepresentation\" and \"rejection of scientific evidence\". According to the president, the \"most diverse biome on Earth\" is home to nearly 50 million people, including 400 Indigenous groups.

Painstaking scientific testing by a team of international experts has been able to debunk a rumour on whether Hitler had Jewish ancestry (he didn't) and determine that he had a genetic disorder which affects the development of sexual organs - all from an old blood-stained swatch of fabric. While clickbait headlines have focused on whether the Nazi dictator had a micropenis and only one testicle, more serious are the findings that his DNA showed \"very high\" scores - in the top 1% - for a predisposition to autism, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Does this mean he had these neurological conditions? Absolutely not, say the experts - it's not a diagnosis. But nevertheless, concerns have been raised about stigmatisation and how ethical the research was, prompting the question - should it have been done at all? \"I agonised over it,\" says Prof Turi King within the first few minutes of Saturday's Channel 4 documentary on the research,Hitler's DNA: Blueprint of a Dictator. The genetics expert told the BBC that when she was first approached to take part in the project several years ago, she was very aware of the potential implications on studying the DNA of someone like Adolf Hitler - \"I'm not interested in sensationalising things\". But, she says, it was likely to be done by someone at some point, and at least under her watch she could ensure the research was done with academic rigour and with all the \"caveats and guardrails in place\". Prof King is no stranger to high-profile and sensitive projects - she led the genetic investigation to establishthe identity of Richard III's skeletonafter it was discovered buried under a car park in Leicester in 2012. The bloodied swatch of fabric - now 80 years old - was cut out of the sofa in Hitler's underground bunker, where he killed himself when Allied forces descended on Berlin at the end of World War Two. While inspecting the bunker, Colonel Roswell P Rosengren of the US army saw an opportunity to get a unique war trophy and he pocketed the fabric. It's now framed and on display at theGettysburg Museum of Historyin the US. The scientists are confident it really is Hitler's blood, because they were able to perfectly match the Y-chromosome with a DNA sample from a male relative that had been collected a decade prior. The results, which are now under peer review, are indeed fascinating. It is the first time Hitler's DNA has been identified, and over the course of four years, scientists were able to sequence it to see the genetic makeup of one of the world's most horrific tyrants. What is certain, experts say, is that Hitler did not have Jewish ancestry - a rumour that had been circulating since the 1920s. Another key finding is that he had Kallmann syndrome, a genetic disorder that, among other things, can affect puberty and the development of sexual organs. In particular, it can lead to a micropenis and undescended testes - which, if you know the British war-time song, had been another rumour flying around about Hitler. Kallmann syndrome can also affect the libido, which is particularly interesting, said historian and Potsdam University lecturer Dr Alex Kay, who is featured in the documentary. \"It tells us a lot about his private life - or more accurately, that he didn't have a private life,\" he explains. Historians have long debated why Hitler was so completely devoted to politics, \"to the almost total exclusion of any kind of private life\", and this could help to explain that. These kinds of findings, the experts say, are what make them both fascinating and useful. As Prof King puts it: \"the marrying of history and genetics\". More complicated and controversial are the results suggesting Hitler may have had one or more neurodiverse or mental health conditions. Looking at his genome, and comparing it with polygenic scores, they found that Hitler had a high predisposition for autism, ADHD, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. This is where the science gets complex. Polygenic scoring combs through a person's DNA and calculates how likely they may be to develop a disease. It can be useful to detect an individual's predisposition to conditions like heart disease and common cancers. But it compares their DNA with a large population sample, and therefore the findings can be far less certain when it comes down to an individual. Throughout the documentary, which the BBC has seen, the experts are at pains to reiterate that the DNA analysis is not a diagnosis, but an indication of predisposition - it does not mean Hitler had any of these conditions. But some genetic scientists have raised concerns that the findings are an oversimplification. Denise Syndercombe Court, professor of forensic genetics at Kings College London, feels they have \"gone too far in their assumptions\". \"In terms of character or behaviour, I'd have thought that's pretty useless,\" Prof Court, who tested the same blood sample in 2018, told the BBC. She said she wouldn't want to make any predictions as to whether someone had a particular condition from the results, because of \"incomplete penetrance\". Put simply, by fellow genetic scientist Dr Sundhya Raman: \"Just because you have something encoded in your DNA, doesn't mean you'll express it.\" This is reflected in the documentary by Prof Simon Baron-Cohen, director of the Autism Research Centre at Cambridge University: \"Going from biology to behaviour is a big jump.\" \"By looking at genetic results like this, there's a risk of stigma. People out there might think, 'Is my diagnosis being linked to somebody who did such monstrous things?'\" \"The risk is reductionism down to genetics,\" he says, when there are so many other factors to consider. The UK's National Autistic Society was quick to respond, calling the findings a \"cheap stunt\". \"Even worse than the shoddy science, we're shocked at [the documentary's] callous disregard for autistic people's feelings,\" said Tim Nicholls, assistant director of research, in a strongly worded statement. \"Autistic people deserve better than this.\" The BBC put the concerns to Channel 4 and Blink Films, the production company that made the documentary. In a statement, it pointed out that experts like Prof Baron-Cohen \"explain that how someone behaves is a product of many factors, not just their genetics but also, very importantly, their environment, everything from childhood and life experiences, how they were brought up, access to education and resources and the cultural factors around them.\" \"The programme emphasises that the genetic insights revealed in the films shed light on Hitler, but they don't tell us he was biologically predestined to behave in a particular way.\" There have also been raised eyebrows at the very name of the documentary, especially the second part:Blueprint of a Dictator. Prof King said it wasn't a name she would have chosen, and historian Prof Thomas Weber, who is featured in the programme, told the BBC he was surprised at the title, given they had stressed there is \"no dictator gene\". The professor, who had not seen the documentary before speaking to the BBC, said he found the DNA analysis both exciting and concerning. \"Exciting, because it confirmed a lot of things I already suspected about Hitler... but I had concerns on whether people would read too much into genetics, like trying to find the 'evil gene'.\" He was also concerned about how it would be received, especially for people with autism and other syndromes mentioned in the programme. There are many difficulties and pitfalls when you're trying to make an accurate programme about complicated science for the general public. \"It's television - it occasionally gets simplified,\" said Prof King, who has a lot of experience balancing her responsibilities as a scientist with the realities of the media. \"They [the documentary makers] could have taken a different tack and gone very sensationalist but they haven't, they've tried to catch some of the nuance... and we've put in the guardrails.\" Channel 4 defended the show's name by saying that \"DNA is colloquially known as the 'blueprint of life'.\" Additionally, its job is to \"make programmes that reach a wide audience, and this programme aims to make complex scientific ideas and historical research accessible to all viewers\". There are many questions on the ethics of the project. Should Hitler's DNA have been examined if his permission - or that of a direct descendant - could not be given? And how does that play into the fact that he was responsible for one of history's worst atrocities? Does that negate his right to privacy? \"This is Hitler - he's not some mystical character whom no one can conduct DNA research on. Who makes that decision?\" Prof King argues. Historian Subhadra Das agrees: \"This is what scientists do. There are hundreds of long-dead people who have had their DNA sampled, it's a common practice in science and archaeology – it's how we read into it that starts to become problematic.\" Historian Dr Kay said he wasn't concerned about the ethical angle, \"as long as the facts were there and we made sure everything was double checked\". And on whether Hitler's DNA should have been touched: \"Hitler's been dead for 80 years. He doesn't have any direct descendants and he didn't have any children. He was responsible for untold suffering – we have to weigh that against the ethical dilemma of analysing his DNA.\" Interestingly, several labs in Europe declined being part of the project, and it was a facility in the US that did the testing. The documentary-makers told the BBC that the research \"has gone through the standard ethical review process for academic work\" which includes reviews conducted in two countries. So should this research have been conducted at all? The BBC spoke to a range of genetic scientists and historians, and the answer depends on who you ask. Those in the documentary, naturally, say yes. It helps to build a more rounded profile of Hitler, a person who still fascinates and terrifies in equal measure. \"We should do whatever we can to understand past extremism,\" Prof Weber believes. \"Let's be honest,\" says Dr Kay, \"these topics were already out there... we haven't suddenly planted this idea in people's minds. People have been speculating on whether Hitler had certain disorders for decades.\" \"I think it's a very dubious way of trying to explain what drove Hitler's actions,\" says Iva Vukusic, assistant professor of international history at Utrecht University. Dr Vukusic, whose studies focus on the perpetration of mass violence, told the BBC she can understand why people are interested, but \"whatever answers we seek are not going to be found through a DNA test\". And while the research is interesting, it runs the risk of obscuring the real lessons of history, says Anne van Mourik, historian at Sciences Po and the NIOD Institute. That lesson is that \"normal people in certain contexts can commit, instigate or accept horrific violence\". Focusing on Hitler's (possible) micropenis, she says, doesn't teach us anything about how mass violence and genocide works and why it occurs. With the study complete and the research under peer review, at some point, the full findings will be available. Prof Weber says they should be used \"extremely carefully and soberly\", but he's hopeful that it is helpful in some way. \"That's the nice thing about research results – it might happen in five, 150, 500 years time. This research is there for posterity and I'm confident that smart people will use them in the future.\" But we all have a responsibility on how we use these results. Dr Kay says everyone must \"follow the science\" and make it clear on what we know and what we don't. That includes the media and how it is reported. \"Anyone watching this documentary has a responsibility to write on it accurately, to make sure they're not contributing to the stigmatisation. \"A documentary like this doesn't exist in a vacuum.\""}

Sheikh Hasina was found guilty of allowing lethal force to be used against protesters, 1,400 of whom died during the unrest last year. Hasina, 78, was tried in absentia by the International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) in Bangladesh, having been exiled in India since she was forced from power in July 2024. Prosecutors accused her of being behind hundreds of killings during the protests. Hasina has denied all charges, calling the trial \"biased and politically motivated\". The months-long tribunal in the ICT, Bangladesh's domestic war crimes court, was widely expected to find her guilty. But the verdict marks a pivotal moment for the nation, vindicating protests that found their roots in anger over years of repression under her rule. It also poses a diplomatic challenge for India and Bangladesh. Dhaka has formally requested Hasina's extradition but so far Delhi has shown no willingness to comply - so her death sentence is unlikely to be carried out. Hasina had governed Bangladesh for 15 years, overseeing economic progress, but increasingly attempting to silence opposition, with politically-motivated arrests, disappearances and extra-judicial killings. The protests saw Hasina forced to flee and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus installed as leader of an interim government. Reacting to the verdict on Monday in a five-page statement, Hasina said the death penalty was the interim government's way of \"nullifying [her party] the Awami League as a political force\" and that she was proud of her government's record on human rights. \"I am not afraid to face my accusers in a proper tribunal where the evidence can be weighed and tested fairly.\" Bangladesh's interim government called the sentence \"historic\" and \"profound\" but called for calm, adding that emotions could run high over the outcome. Meanwhile, Judge Golam Mortuza Mozumder said Hasina was found guilty on three counts including incitement, ordering killings and failing to prevent atrocities during the uprising. \"We have decided to inflict her with only one sentence - that is, sentence of death,\" he said. The student-led uprising last year started with demands to abolish government job quotas but morphed into a wider anti-government movement. UN human rights investigators said in a report in February that the approximately 1,400 deaths could amount to \"crimes against humanity\". The report documented the shooting at point-blank range of some protesters, the deliberate maiming of others, arbitrary arrests and torture. Reacting to Hasina's sentence, the UN Human Rights Office said this was an \"important moment for victims\" - but it regretted the \"imposition of the death penalty, which we oppose in all circumstances\". Leaked audio of one of Hasina's phone calls verified by BBC Eye earlier this year suggested she had authorised the use of \"lethal weapons\" in July 2024. The audio was played in court during the trial. Ahead of the verdict, the capital, Dhaka, where the tribunal took place, was under tightened security, with many of Hasina's critics staging a rally and cheering as the judgement was read. The city has seen a recent spike in unrest, with dozens of bombs exploded and buses set on fire in the days leading up to the verdict. At least one bomb explosion was reported in Dhaka on Monday morning, with no casualties reported, local police official Jisanul Haque told the BBC. Family members of those killed during the protests earlier told the BBC they wanted Hasina to be punished severely. Ramjan Ali, whose brother was shot dead in July 2024, said he wanted \"exemplary punishment\" for Hasina and others who have \"committed acts of vengeance and abused their power\". Lucky Akther, whose husband was killed near Dhaka in August 2024, said she wanted Hasina's sentence to be \"carried out before the election\". \"Only then the families of those killed [in the protests] will find peace in their hearts.\" Since Hasina's ousting, an interim government led by economist Muhammad Yunus has taken charge. A parliamentary election is scheduled for February 2026. However, the Awami League, Hasina's political party, was banned by Bangladesh's interim government in May. Hasina warned last month that if the party's candidates were banned from standing in the upcoming election, millions would boycott the vote. Hasina's state-appointed lawyer Mohammad Amir Hossain said he was \"sad [and wishes] the verdict had been different\". \"I even cannot appeal because my clients are absent; that's why I am sad,\" he added. Last week, Hasina's lawyers said they had filed an urgent appeal to the UN, raising serious fair trial and due process issues at the ICT. She says she has \"repeatedly challenged\" the interim government to bring its charges to the International Criminal Court in the Hague. Hasina was tried alongside her former home minister and police chief. While the sentence offers some closure to families of killed in the protests, it may do little to soothe the country's political divisions. \"The anger against Sheikh Hasina and the Awami League has not subsided,\" Shireen Huq, a Dhaka-based rights activists told the BBC. \"Neither she nor the party has apologised or shown any remorse for the killings of hundreds of people.\" She said \"it makes it difficult for the party to be accepted by a majority of people in this country\". Ms Huq, who is against capital punishment, added that the punishment was not closure for the families of those killed and injured. \"We work with several people who lost their limbs forever, they are amputees now, due to the crackdown. They will never be able to forgive her.\" David Bergman, a journalist and a long-time Bangladesh watcher, said the \"very nature of the conviction could make it even more difficult\" for Awami League to become a normal feature of Bangladeshi politics again. This may change if \"there is some kind of apology and a distancing from Sheikh Hasina and the old leadership\", he said."}

But within hours of the tickets going on sale, that excitement is often replaced by disappointment and complaints about the number of tickets immediately being offered for resale at extortionate prices. However,proposed new rules due to be announced by the governmenton Wednesday are intended to change that by making it illegal to resell tickets for live events above their original cost. The measures, designed to end industrial-scale ticket touting, will be arguably the most significant change to ticket-buying in the online age. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy told BBC News: \"We're making sure that time is up for the ticket touts and that fans get to be back at the heart of the music industry where they belong.\" It comes a week after artists such asSam Fender, Dua Lipa and Coldplay urgedPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to protect fans from exploitation. Here's everything you need to know about the plans. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) is expected to officially announce on Wednesday that: It's not yet clear when the rules will come into effect, as the plans still have to go through the House of Commons. It's thought the government will introduce primary legislation when Parliamentary time allows. The new rules will not just apply to concerts but also sport, theatre, comedy and other types of live entertainment. Ticket touting has become increasingly sophisticated in recent years. Touts buy large numbers of tickets for the most popular events online, often with the help of automated bots. These tickets are then relisted on secondary websites for hugely inflated prices, which many feel disappoints fans and damages the live events industry. The new laws are intended to stamp out this practice, with the intention of improving both access and affordability for genuine fans. The rules would apply to any platform reselling tickets to UK fans - not just secondary ticketing websites, but also social media. That means fans offering tickets on platforms such as X or Facebook Marketplace would be legally obliged to adhere to the rules. Businesses that break the regulations could be subject to financial penalties of up to 10% of global turnover from the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). The amount of money fans will save will of course vary wildly between each show and each ticket. Some fans might just save a few pounds, while others buying tickets for the most popular events could save hundreds or even thousands on what they would have spent on a resale platform. Analysis conducted for the government estimates that resale tickets will be £37 cheaper on average (including fees), collectively saving fans about £112m per year. About 900,000 more tickets will be bought directly from primary sellers each year as a result of the measures, the analysis suggests. Typical mark-ups on secondary market tickets exceed 50%, according to the CMA, while investigations by Trading Standards have uncovered evidence of tickets being resold for up to six times their original cost. Some in the ticketing industry have argued that these rules will simply push ticket reselling to darker corners of the internet. Most regulated secondary platforms guarantee the authenticity of tickets, meaning fans get their money back if any tickets they buy turn out to be fake. Those outlets argue that, if they were shut down or severely restricted, fans will actually be more exposed to fraudulent transactions elsewhere and be more likely to lose their money. Nandy said the government had \"looked really closely\" at that issue, \"and we're confident that we have dealt with that, not least because under these new rules, social media platforms will also be covered\". \"So if you're a ticket tout selling tickets at vastly inflated prices on a social media platform, the platform will have to take steps to make sure that that doesn't happen. \"And if they don't comply, the Competition and Markets Authority will have the right to intervene and be able to fine companies up to 10% of their annual turnover wherever they're headquartered in the world.\" Old-school physical ticket touting could even make a comeback - where touts stand outside venues on the night of concerts buying and selling physical tickets for cash. A spokesman for Viagogo, one of the main secondary ticket sites, said: \"Evidence shows price caps have repeatedly failed fans, in countries like Ireland and Australia fraud rates are nearly four times higher than in the UK as price caps push consumers towards unregulated sites.\" Viagogo argues the correct solution is \"open distribution\", which means connecting primary platforms such as Ticketmaster with resale platforms such as Viagogo to verify tickets. \"This allows the sharing of critical information to identify illegal bot activity and eliminate fraud,\" Viagogo said. \"Opening the market to greater competition also helps drive prices down, benefiting fans.\" BBC News has also asked Stubhub for a response to the plans. Twickets, a resale platform championed by musicians such as Ed Sheeran, already only allows fans to sell tickets at no more than face value. Richard Davies, founder of Twickets, described the proposals as a \"landmark moment for consumer protection in live entertainment\", adding the company \"fully supports the government's plans\". \"For too long, fans have been exploited by industrial-scale touting that drives up prices, damages trust and locks genuine supporters out of the events they love,\" he said. Campaign group FairTicketing warned the plans could have \"unintended consequences\", suggesting that the cap on resale tickets could lead to more dynamic pricing, \"allowing primary sellers to hike prices as demand surges\". \"Far from curbing exploitation, this has simply shifted the burden onto fans at the point of initial sale,\" chairman Stephen Lee said. \"While we applaud efforts to tackle bad actors and bot-driven exploitation, we firmly believe that imposing a price cap would do more harm than good, exacerbating the very problems it aims to solve and undermining the benefits that a regulated secondary market provides to fans.\" Another issue that has riled live music fans in recent years is the use of so-called dynamic pricing, where ticket prices fluctuate according to demand. It hit the headlines when Oasis's reunion tour went on sale last year after many fans found themselves paying hundreds of pounds more than they expected. The CMAsaid in Septemberit had not found evidence that prices for Oasis tickets were actually changed in real time because of the high demand, but the backlash led the authority to secure a commitment from Ticketmaster to improve pricing information. This includes giving fans 24 hours' notice of tiered pricing, providing clearer price information during online queues, and ending misleading ticket labelling. As things stand, dynamic pricing will still be allowed, but companies will have to be more open about it with fans. Last week, the Royal Ballet and Operaannounced it would introduce demand-led ticket pricingin a bid to \"maximise\" its revenue. Under the proposals, consumers will still be allowed to resell their tickets if they want to, for example if they can no longer attend an event. However, individuals will only be able to legally resell their ticket for its original cost (or less), plus any service fees. The resale platform itself might then add its own service charge, \"but we are really clear that we will not tolerate any price increases by the back door\", Nandy said. \"Reasonable service fees that cover the costs of platforms to be able to ensure that fans can resell a ticket at the original cost [are allowed].  If fans can't go to a gig for whatever reason, it's fine. \"What is not fine is vastly inflating prices so that fans price out of the market.\""}

Trump's comments appeared to contradict a US intelligence assessment in 2021 which determined the crown prince had approved the operation that led to Khashoggi's death at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018. The crown prince, who has denied any wrongdoing, said at the White House that Saudi Arabia \"did all the right things\" to investigate Khashoggi's death, which he called \"painful\". It was his first US visit since the assassination, which sent shockwaves through the US-Saudi relationship. In the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump shot back at a reporter who asked a question about the killing. \"You're mentioning someone that was extremely controversial,\" the US president said. \"A lot of people didn't like that gentleman that you're talking about. Whether you like him or didn't like him, things happen.\" \"But he [the Crown Prince] knew nothing about it,\" Trump added. \"You don't have to embarrass our guests.\" The crown prince added that Saudi Arabia \"did all the right steps\" to investigate the murder, which he called \"painful\" and a \"huge mistake\". A US intelligence report made public in 2021- under President Joe Biden's administration - determined that the crown prince had approved of a plan to \"capture or kill\" Khashoggi in Istanbul. During his first administration, Trump White House officials declined to release the report. While dozens of Saudi officials faced sanctions in the wake of the assassination, none directly targeted the crown prince. Reacting to Trump's comments, Khashoggi's widow, Hanan, told BBC Newsnight the US president's defence of the crown prince did not match up with bin Salman's own acknowledgment of responsibility for her husband's murder. \"The crown prince himself, in 2019 and 60 Minutes interview, he did take accountability about and hold responsibility about this horrible crime,\" she said. In a post on X, she also called for a meeting with the crown prince and an apology along with compensation for her husband's murder. Granted political asylum in the US, she lives in the Washington DC area. Tuesday's meeting between Trump and Mohammed bin Salman was expected to include deals on civilian nuclear power, artificial intelligence and Saudi investment in the US, which the crown prince said was being upped to $1tr (£761bn) from $600bn pledged earlier this year. Echoing Trump's own words, bin Salman said that the US was the \"hottest country on the planet\" and praised the US president for creating \"long-term opportunity\". The two men also discussed the potential sale of advanced F-35 fighter aircraft to the Saudis. Trump said that while export licences were still being announced, he expected a deal between the Saudis and US defence giant Lockheed Martin. The potential sale has caused alarm among some Israeli officials, who have said that it could potentially hurt the country's \"qualitative military edge\" in the Middle East, where it is so far the only nation to have F-35s. The US president said the model sold to the Saudis would be broadly similar to the one the Israelis operate. \"This [Saudi Arabia] is a great ally, and Israel is a great ally,\" Trump said. \"I know they'd like you to get planes of reduced calibre. \"But as far as I'm concerned, I think they are both at a level where they should get top of the line,\" he added. The crown prince's visit to Washington continues with a gala dinner on Tuesday night, followed by an investment summit on Wednesday. Portuguese footballer Cristiano Ronaldo - who plays in the Saudi professional league -was also present at the dinner. Biden did not host the crown prince and vowed to make Saudi Arabia a \"pariah\" over its human rights record. In 2022, however, Biden visited the kingdom to reach agreement on other issues."}

Approval of the plan, which was first presented in January, is expected to bring to an end a torturous legal effort to hold the OxyContin-maker and its owners, the Sackler family, to account and finally release long-sought funding for people struggling with addiction. Purduefiled for bankruptcy protectionin 2019, as it faced thousands of lawsuits accusing it of fuelling the opioid epidemic. The settlement marks an increase of more than $1bn from a previous deal, which the US Supreme Courtrejected last year. \"Today cements the end of a long chapter, and brings us very near to the end of the book for Purdue,\" Steve Miller, chairman of the Purdue board, said in a statement on Friday. The restructuring plan, he said, \"unlocks billions in recoveries and significant non-monetary benefits\". The deal requires the Sacklers to relinquish ownership of the company. A nonprofit called Knoa Pharma will take its place as a \"purpose-driven company with the mission to address the opioid crisis\", Mr Miller said. Purdue became a household name in the US as the maker and promoter of OxyContin, a prescription painkiller that often served as an entryway into drugs like heroin. The medication has been blamed for supercharging the deadly opioid crisis in America, which has been linked to 900,000 deaths in the US since 1999. In thousands of lawsuits, Purdue and members of the Sackler family were later accused of aggressively marketing OxyContin, while misleading doctors and patients over its addiction and overdose risks. Purdue pleaded guilty in 2020 in a separate criminal case brought by the Department of Justice. But that agreement did not address lawsuits brought by local, state, Native American tribal governments and others, which had helped to precipitate the bankruptcy. A previous settlement, which the Supreme Court struck down last year, would have shielded members of the Sackler family from future civil lawsuits over their role in fuelling the opioid crisis. The nation's top court ruled that granting such protections to the Sacklers, who did not themselves declare bankruptcy, was not authorised under law. The latest $7.4bn deal does not grant the Sacklers immunity from future opioid-related lawsuits. Members of the family are now poised to contribute between $6.5bn and $7bn as part of the agreement. They have long denied wrongdoing. Some individuals voiced objections to the deal during an earlier bankruptcy hearing, arguing it did not go far enough to compensate victims directly. Individual victims are expected to receive up to $865mn. But the settlement garnered overwhelming support from government groups and personal injury victims. More than 99% of creditors voted in favor of the bankruptcy restructuring plan, Purdue said in October. State and local governments will receive most of the settlement money. Many have said the agreement would fund support for opioid addiction treatment and prevention across the US. \"By holding Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family accountable for their role in fueling the opioid epidemic, we're bringing much-needed funds for addiction treatment, prevention, and recovery to those impacted by this crisis,\" California Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a statement in June, when 55 attorneys general agreed to sign on to the settlement."}

In May, Strange Brew called off a concert by London group Oi Va Voi, who bill themselves as a modern folk klezmer band. The venue has now said it recognises the complaints and scrutiny of the group were likely only \"because they are a Jewish band performing with an Israeli singer\". In a statement, Oi Va Voi said the \"intimidation of the activist groups who wanted Strange Brew to cancel our gig would never be tolerated against any other minority\", adding that \"this episode has had an immense personal and emotional impact on us\". \"It has also led to financial loss, reputational damage and a barrage of hate, the like of which we had never experienced before,\" they said on Wednesday. The group said the complaints had come from activists \"making untrue and misguided claims about us, our music and the album artwork of guest performer Zohara\". \"The only reason we received a level of scrutiny that would lead to such false accusations is because of our heritage and the nationality of one of our performers,\" they said. They also criticised \"the readiness of venues, promoters and festivals to cave in to demands that exclude Jewish artists\", but welcomed Strange Brew's new statement. The venue said: \"We made a last-minute decision to cancel this performance following complaints about the band from activist groups, including about Zohara's solo album artwork. \"We have reflected on this decision and have realised that we made a mistake in doing so. We recognise that Oi Va Voi was likely only subjected to this level of scrutiny, and Zohara's album artwork interpreted negatively, because they are a Jewish band performing with an Israeli singer. \"Oi Va Voi are musicians, not activists. They have no political affiliations and, as far as we are aware, have never made any political statements, be it in their music or otherwise.\" Strange Brew added that it was \"not in line with our values to exclude Oi Va Voi and Zohara from performing on the basis of conjecture by another group about their views\". The 330-capacity venue said it had implemented compulsory antisemitism training for senior management and had made a donation to the Community Security Trust, which seeks to protect British Jews from antisemitism. Oi Va Voi grew in prominence in the early 2000s andhave been praised for putting Jewishmusic \"on the international map\", using klezmer music - a musical tradition of the Ashkenazi Jews of eastern Europe."}

Bullet holes pepper the front door to the house in the Iraqi town of Haditha, where she grew up. Inside the back bedroom, a colourful bedspread covers the bed where her family was shot. This is where she hid with her five siblings, mum and aunt when US marines stormed into their home and opened fire, killing everyone apart from Safa, on 19 November 2005. Her dad was also shot dead when he opened the front door. Now, 20 years on, a BBC Eye investigation has uncovered evidence that implicates two marines, who were never brought to trial, in the killing of Safa's family, according to a forensic expert. The evidence - mainly statements and testimony given in the aftermath of the killings - raises doubts about the American investigation into what happened that day, and poses significant questions over how US armed forces are held to account. The killing of Safa's family was part of what became known as the Haditha massacre, when US marines killed 24 Iraqi civilians, including four women and six children. They entered three homes killing nearly everyone inside, as well as a driver and four students in a car, who were on their way to college. The incident triggered the longest US war crimes investigation of the Iraq war, but no-one was convicted of the killings. The marines said they were responding to gunfire after a roadside bomb went off, killing one of their squad members, and injuring two others. But Safa, who was 13 at the time, tells the World Service: \"We hadn't been accused of anything. We didn't even have any weapons in the house.\" She survived by pretending to be dead among the small bodies of her sisters and brother - the youngest was three years old. \"I was the only survivor out of my entire family,\" she says. Four marines were initially charged with murder, but they gave conflicting accounts of the events, and over time US military prosecutors dropped charges against three of them, granting them immunity from further legal action. That left squad leader Staff Sergeant Frank Wuterich as the only one to face trial in 2012. In a video recording of a pre-trial hearing, which has never been broadcast before, the most junior member of the squad, Lance Corporal Humberto Mendoza is questioned and re-enacts events at Safa's house. Mendoza - who was a private at the time and was never charged - admits to killing Safa's father when he opened the front door to the marines. \"Did you see his hands?\" a lawyer asks him. \"Yes sir,\" Mendoza responds, and goes on to confirm that Safa's father was not armed. \"But you shot him anyways?\" the lawyer asks. \"Yes sir,\" Mendoza says. Outside the UK, watch the film onYouTube. Viewers in the UK can see more on Global Eye at 19:00 on BBC Two In his official statements, Mendoza had initially claimed that after entering the house, he opened the door to the bedroom where Safa and her family were, but when he saw there were only women and children inside he did not go in, and instead shut the door. However, in a newly discovered audio recording from Wuterich's trial, Mendoza gives a different account. He says that he walked about 8ft (2.4m) into the bedroom. This is hugely significant, according to forensic expert Michael Maloney. The Naval Criminal Investigative Service sent him to Haditha in 2006 to investigate the killings and he examined the bedroom where Safa's family was shot. Using the crime scene photos taken by the Marine Corps at the time of the killings, he concluded that two marines had entered the room and shot the women and children. When we played him the recording of Mendoza saying he had walked into the room, Maloney said: \"This is just amazing to me, what we're listening to, and I've never heard this before today.\" He said it showed Mendoza was placing himself in the position where Maloney concluded the first shooter stood, at the foot of the bed. \"If you were to ask me: 'Is this a confession of sorts?' What I'd say is: 'Mendoza confessed to everything except for pulling the trigger.'\" Safa had given a video deposition to military prosecutors in 2006 but it was never shown in court. In it, she described how the marine who opened the bedroom door threw in a grenade, which failed to explode, and then the same man came into the room and shot her family. Mendoza is the only marine who ever said he opened the door. Another marine, Lance Corporal Stephen Tatum did not deny he took part in the shootings, but said he had followed the squad leader, Wuterich, into the bedroom and initially claimed he did not know there were women and children there because of poor visibility. But in three later statements obtained by the BBC, Tatum gave a different account. \"I saw that children were in the room kneeling down. I don't remember the exact number but only that it was a lot. I am trained to shoot two shots to the chest and two shots to the head and I followed my training,\" Tatum told the Naval Criminal Investigative Service in April 2006. A month later, he said he \"was able to positively identify the people in the room as women and children before shooting them\". And then a week after that, he said: \"This is where I saw the kid I shot. Knowing it was a kid, I still shot him.\" He described the child as wearing a white T-shirt, standing on the bed, and having short hair. Tatum's defence lawyers claimed these later statements had been obtained under duress. Charges against Tatum were dropped in March 2008, and the statements were disregarded at Wuterich's trial. Forensics expert Michael Maloney said the statements by Mendoza and Tatum point to them being the two marines who shot Safa's family. He believes Mendoza went into the bedroom first and Tatum followed \"firing across the head of the bed\". We put the allegations to Mendoza and Tatum. Mendoza did not respond. He has previously admitted to shooting Safa's father, but said he was following orders. He was never charged with a criminal offence. Through his lawyer, Tatum said he wants to put Haditha behind him. He has never withdrawn his testimony that he was one of the shooters in Safa's house. Maloney told the BBC that the prosecution \"wanted Wuterich to be that primary shooter\". But before Maloney was able to testify, Wuterich's trial ended in a plea deal. Wuterich maintained he could not remember what had happened in Safa's house, and agreed to plead guilty to one count of negligent dereliction of duty - a charge unrelated to any direct involvement in the killings. Wuterich's military lawyer, Haytham Faraj, a former marine himself, said the punishment was \"tantamount to a slap on the wrist… like a speeding ticket\". Neal Puckett, the lead defence lawyer for Wuterich, said the whole investigation and prosecution against his client was \"botched\". \"The prosecution, in granting immunity to all their witnesses and dismissing all their charges… essentially rendered themselves incapable of achieving justice in this case,\" he said. Haytham Faraj agreed the process was deeply flawed. \"The government paid people to come in and lie, and the payment was immunity, and that's how they misused the legal process,\" he told the BBC. \"The trial of Haditha was never meant to give voice to the victims,\" he added. He said that survivors' \"impressions of a show trial with no real outcome, with no-one being punished, was right\". The US Marine Corps told us it is committed to fair and open proceedings under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, ensuring due process of law. It added that it would not reopen the investigation unless a wealth of new, unexamined, and admissible evidence was introduced. The lead prosecutor in the case did not respond to the BBC's request for comment. Now aged 33, Safa still lives in Haditha and has three children of her own. She says she can't understand how no marine was punished for her family's deaths. When we show her the video of Mendoza, she says he \"should have been imprisoned from the moment the incident happened, it should have been impossible for him to see the light of day\". \"It's as if it happened last year. I still think about it,\" she says of the day her family was killed. \"I want those who did this to be held accountable and to be punished by the law. It's been almost 20 years without them being tried. That's the real crime.\" Additional reporting by Namak Khoshnaw and Michael Epstein"}

Not only has itcaptivated toddlers and terrorised adults around the world,it laid the foundations for its creator Pinkfong to become a media business worth hundreds of millions of dollars. “We didn’t expect it to stand out from our other content,\" Mr Kim, Pinkfong's chief executive, told the BBC from the firm's headquarters in Seoul. \"But looking back, it became a major turning point that set the stage for our global journey.” On Tuesday, that journey took Pinkfong to the South Korean stock market, where its shares rose by more than 9% on their debut, giving it a valuation of more than $400m (£304m). Founded in 2010 as SmartStudy, the firm made digital content for children up to 12 years of age. It had just three employees, including Mr Kim and the firm's chief technology officer, Dongwoo Son. \"The office was tiny - even smaller than this,\" recalled Mr Kim, gesturing to the conference room he was calling from. It was so small \"we didn't even expect a salary at the time\", he said through a translator. Pinkfong went through several major overhauls, including shifting its focus to toddlers. The firm grew to around 100 employees and prioritised simpler, learning-based games and content. \"And that's when Baby Shark emerged,\" Mr Kim said. The firm has been known as The Pinkfong Company since 2022, a name inspired by a cheerful and curious fox that featured in one of its early cartoons. It now has around 340 employees, with offices in Tokyo, Shanghai and Los Angeles. Baby Shark is believed to have originated in the US in the 1970s and was often sung at children's summer camps. The song, which repeats the phrase \"Baby shark, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo\" is \"attractive for children, though possibly annoying for adults,\" said media analyst Kevin Chew from the Nanyang Technological University. Mr Kim is also very aware of just how catchy it is. \"It's like a K-pop song. It's very fast-paced, rhythmical and it's addictive,\" he said, adding that the tune has a \"chanting\" effect, which makes it easy for children to remember. But it was not an instant hit and only gained traction when its dance routine was featured at children's events in South East Asia. Videos of children and adults dancing to the song started to spread online and the clip went viral. There was a \"festival-like feeling\" in the Pinkfong office, as the team watched its viewing numbers soar, Mr Kim said. In November 2020, the Baby Shark clip claimed the title of YouTube's most viewed. It generated around half of the firm's revenue in the years immediately after the video's release and became a springboard for new content and merchandise, he said. But Pinkfong faced a legal challenge in 2019 when it was accused ofplagiarising the work of an American composer. South Korea's Supreme Court rejected the case, after the company argued that its version was derived from a folk song in the public domain. The victory, Mr Kim said, gave the firm a lift as its shares went public. He added that the stock market application had been filed before the verdict was announced. Pinkfong's other franchises like Bebefinn and Sealook are growing fast but the firm must prove its success is not just reliant on Baby Shark, said Korea University business lecturer Min Jung Kim. The company's target audience is a major plus as toddlers tend to watch the same material repeatedly, she said. Kim Min-seok insists his business can grow beyond Baby Shark, which currently accounts for about a quarter of Pinkfong's revenue. Meanwhile, Bebefinn has leapt ahead, generating roughly 40% of the firm's earnings. One parent told the BBC that his family has mixed feelings about Pinkfong's videos. Father of two Saleem Nashef said he appreciates the educational qualities of the firm's content but his wife thinks Baby Shark is \"too over-stimulating for kids\". Still, the viral video is apparently inescapable, as his daughter, who is about to turn three, will have a Baby Shark-themed birthday party. Whether Pinkfong can create other characters to match Baby Shark's commercial appeal remains unclear, said Prof Kim. It raised almost $52m in its stock market debut and plans to use the money to expand its line-up of films and characters, said Mr Kim. The company also aims to become a \"tech-driven\" content creator, using viewing patterns and other data to shape its new projects. Pinkfong has already achieved \"what many creators have always dreamed of,\" Mr Kim said. But now it must show investors that it is not just a one-hit wonder.

He was the pregnant sheila's hubby. Like his missus, he was pretty good looking himself.\" Those lines are straight from a new translation of Leo Tolstoy's epic novel War & Peace, set in the world of Russian high society in the early 19th century. Except this is a \"bogan\" version translated by Ander Louis, the pen name of a Melbourne IT worker who moonlights as a writer. He's poured a metaphorical can of Australian beer over the novel by converting Tolstoy's prose into a lingo that wouldn't sound out of place in the popular Aussie sitcom Kath & Kim. \"It's how you'd tell it down the pub,\" Louis, whose real name is Andrew Tesoriero, told the BBC. The 39-year-old started the project in 2018 as a joke, turning Russian princesses into \"sheilas\" and princes into \"drongos\", but is now on the cusp of signing a book deal. \"The number one reason I started doing it was to make me laugh, and I thought if it's making me laugh, maybe other people will too so let's put it out into the world.\" Bogan, a term which first emerged in Australia in the 1980s, initially meant an \"unsophisticated and uncultured person\" with negative connotations, but not for Louis. \"I've never really thought of it as an insult, more a term of endearment,\" he says. And his version of the Russian literary masterpiece - which starts with the phrase \"bloody hell\" - is about being flippant and irreverent. \"It's just a good exclamation of surprise,\" Louis jokes. Elsewhere, a noble is a fair dinkum, while the death of an important character is announced by \"he's cactus\". \"It changes the tone quite significantly,\" Louis laughs. For years, Louis avoided picking up War & Peace, set during the Napoleonic wars of the early 1800s, given its heft. The novel is divided into 15 books as well as an epilogue, which itself is split into two parts. With more than 1,200 pages to plough through, it's often regarded as the Everest of literature with prose as insurmountable as the famed peak. But in 2016, Louis joined an online community where participants pledge to finish the book in a year by reading at least one chapter – there are 361 – every day. He loved it so much, he did it twice. \"I became a bit of an accidental expert,\" he tells the BBC from Lilydale, on the outskirts of Melbourne. During this time, the part-time indie author was writing a novel with dark psychological themes so to lighten the mood, he started making War & Peace irreverent and funny. And for more than six years, Louis' project remained a little-known hobby he did in his spare time, self-publishing the first two translated books of War & Peace and selling a handful of copies. That all changed earlier this year when a New York-based tech writer stumbled across the bogan version, posting excerpts from Louis' book in which he describes Napoleon as an \"alright bloke\", the high-ranking Prince Vasili as \"a pretty big deal\" and Princess Bolkónskaya as \"smoking hot\". \"Out of nowhere, it just went berserk. Overnight, I sold 50 copies,\" Louis says. The father-of-two thinks the US interest in his bogan translation might be due to a \"Bluey effect\" given the popular Australian children's cartoon has been the most streamed show in the US for almost two years. \"Aussie-isms are in vogue over there at the moment\". At first glance Tolstoy's book, filled with the lives of rich, powerful Russians, seems worlds apart from modern-day Australia. But Louis argues bogan is the ultimate equaliser as the informal slang works across the social spectrum, whether it's in Australia or the world of Russian aristocrats. \"There's a whole lot of different types of bogan,\" Louis says. Mark Gwynn, a senior researcher at the Australian National University, who helps compile the Australian National Dictionary, agrees. \"Bogans can be wealthy, poor, or in the middle so it's more about the way they behave, dress, socialise and talk,\" he says. He says in more recent times, the term has also been used affectionately of someone considered a bogan or even in reference to oneself such as the term \"inner bogan\". And speaking \"bogan\" refers to casual speech with lots of local sayings, he says. \"Most Australians would know if you said 'speaks bogan' or 'bogan Australian' that the language would be highly informal with many slang and colloquial words and phrases, including uniquely Australian ones.\" But there's no direct translation for the term in proper English – it's uniquely Australian. \"Bogans can live in [both] rural and urban areas so they don't equate to hillbillies, bumpkins, yokels, rustics,\" Gwynn says. Nor are bogans the same as rednecks, as they can hold varied political views, while the British term \"chav\" – also typically used in a derogatory way to describe people from a poor background - doesn't apply either. Those shape-shifting bogan qualities along with Louis' varied resume - kitchen hand, energy analyst, Uber driver, punk rocker, Tokyo resident – makes him \"strangely qualified\" to create a bogan translation. \"When I'm drawing on voices, it's just quite genuinely from things I've seen and done… through all those different walks of life.\" Characters in his bogan version say \"g'day\", friends are \"mates\" and those with questionable ethics are deemed \"shonky\". Beautiful ladies are \"chicky babes\", with one so beguiling she's \"hot as a tin roof in Alice\" – a nod to the extreme heat of Alice Springs' desert landscape. One prince is an \"absolute true-blue legend\" whose vibrant eyes \"blazed like a bushfire\" while another is a \"bit of a yobbo\" who thinks others are \"carrying on like a pack of galahs\". While his version is peppered with plenty of profanity – which the BBC can't publish – part of the appeal is to make the book more accessible. \"The best feedback I've found is people saying how much easier it is to understand what's going on,\" he says. Louis likens himself to Pierre, the main protagonist in War & Peace, who represents the \"everyman\" as the illegitimate son of a rich aristocrat who inherits a huge fortune, catapulting him into Russian high society. He says he feels like he's the \"bumbling buffoon\" in the \"walled garden that is traditional publishing\" and that he's committed a kind of \"literary heist\". \"I've leaned over the fence… and just pinched the crown jewel - their most revered book - and taken it down the pub.\" And what would Tolstoy – who, though born a noble, later in life renounced his privileged upbringing and wealth – think of the bogan version? \"I actually think he would get a kick out it,\" Louis says."}

Clearly, losing two quality fast bowlers inPat CumminsandJosh Hazlewoodto injuries is a huge spanner in the works, doubly so when Cummins is the captain. But what team wouldn't suffer if they lost two key players? England did not have Ben Stokes and Jofra Archer in the side for their last Test, against India at The Oval in July. They lost. If you take out the scenario of the two injuries, Australia have only ever had one decision to make, which is around the top order. Australia have not had a consistent opening partner for Usman Khawaja since David Warner retired at the beginning of last year. Five different men have been tried in the space of 18 months. They have tried band-aid options, perhaps trying to replicate the success of moving Justin Langer up from number three to open with Matthew Hayden in the team I played in. Realistically, if you lose an opener, you should replace him with an opener. You wouldn't replace a fast bowler with a wicketkeeper. For that reason, Australia will probably end the shuffling of the order, leave Marnus Labuschagne at number three and give a debut to Jake Weatherald. From there, the rest of the batting order takes care of itself. Cameron Green drops to fill the all-rounder role at number six, meaning Beau Webster is squeezed out. It's tough on Webster, who has done nothing wrong. The other criticism heading towards Australia is the age of the team. The likely XI for the first Test at Optus Stadium on Friday will only have Green under the age of 30. I really do not see that as a problem in this Ashes series. The reason this team has grown old together is because it has been successful together. With age comes experience. I played in a team in a similar situation in the 2006-07 Ashes. We only had Michael Clarke under the age of 30 and we won 5-0. Maybe it will be an issue for the selectors over the next 12 to 18 months as players end their careers, but it's not one to be addressed now. So long as a player is performing, age does not matter. I do wonder about the process that has led to both Cummins and Hazlewood being made unavailable for the first Test. It feels like things have changed so much in the decision-making surrounding players, that backroom staff and those outside the dressing room might have too much influence. We did not have routine scans. If you were not quite at 100%, but felt you could push through and play, you played. Now there is a trend to err on the side of caution. If a player feels a niggle, he is told to rest. If I had gone through routine scans, I like to think I would have been OK. I only had a short delivery stride, so there was not the strain on my back. It was in good condition when I played and still is today. But my old new-ball partner Jason Gillespie reckons he would never have played a Test if he was put through routine scans. His back would have lit up like a Christmas tree. The hope for Australia is Cummins and Hazlewood are fit for the second Test in Brisbane, because England will certainly view the home attack in a different light without them. In home Tests played without both Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood in the XI, the Aussies have not lost in 13 years. I got a close look at the England team, and their approach under Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum, during the Ashes in the UK in 2023. I love England's method, but I'm not sure about this idea of ridding players of pressure and expectation. To me, the very best players thrive under pressure. They want to stand up and meet expectations. The bigger the stage, the better they perform. You should not try to rid pressure and expectation, you should use them as motivation. Besides, if England believe this is their best chance to win in Australia since 2010-11, is that not a pressure of its own? I saw Stuart Broadsay this is the weakest Australia teamsince the last time England won here 14 years ago. Really? The last three series England have played here they have lost 5-0, 4-0 and 4-0. They have not come close to winning a Test and were lucky not to lose every single one. It's a huge call to say this is the \"weakest\" Australian team in 15 years. If Australia win 3-0, it would be a fantastic result, but still not as dominant as the previous three. Does that make them the weakest? The challenge for England is to adapt to the conditions. The pitch in Perth will be the quickest, most bouncy of the five Tests. Touring teams can see the ball fly through and get carried away, bowling too short. When the pitch is fast and bouncy, you have to find the right length. It's not just the pitches that will be alien to England. The Kookaburra ball feels different in the hand to the Dukes ball used in the UK. The Kookaburra feels bigger, with a smaller seam. It offers much less assistance. And how will England play Bazball on the big Australian grounds? English grounds are smaller. If you're going to try to hit sixes in Australia, make sure you hit them a long way, otherwise you'll be caught. When England are confident, they can be a real handful. They have a huge chance in the first Test, with Cummins and Hazlewood missing. If they can take that chance, it will give them confidence for the rest of the series. If England lose in Perth, they could be in for a very long series.

Prices are rising at their slowest pace for four months, helped by smaller rises in household energy costs and lower hotel costs, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Economists had expected a slightly bigger fall from September's 3.8% to 3.5%. The latest inflation report comes just a week ahead of the government's much-anticipated Budget. \"I'm determined to do more to bring prices down,\" said Chancellor Rachel Reeves, after the latest data was released. \"I recognise that inflation and the cost of living is still a big burden on families across country,\" she said. Reeves has said easing cost-of-living pressures is one of the main goals of the Budget, which is expected to include a combination of tax rises and spending cuts to shore up the government finances. The biggest upward pressure on prices came from food and non-alcoholic drinks, the ONS said. The 12-month inflation rate for food was 4.9% in October, up from 4.5% in September. Bread, meat, fish, vegetables, chocolate and confectionary were among the products that rose in price. However fruit prices fell slightly. The fall in inflation means prices are rising more slowly than they were and will foster hope that inflation has peaked, helping to pave the way for lower interest rates. Inflation remains above the Bank of England's 2% target but the next interest rate decision, due on 18 December, will focus on the longer term impact of raising the cost of borrowing. \"Inflation eased in October, driven mainly by gas and electricity prices, which increased less than this time last year, following changes in the Ofgem energy price cap,\" said ONS chief economist Grant Fitzner. Household energy prices, which are capped by the regulator, rose in the year to October. But the 2% rise in the cap was significantly less than the 9.6% hike last year. The ONS said another factor pulling back inflation was hotel prices. Hotel rates typically fall between the summer and Christmas, but this year they dipped more than last year. However, fuel prices have risen, affecting drivers and the cost of deliveries. \"The annual cost of raw materials for businesses continued to increase, while factory gate prices also rose,\" Mr Fitzner added. The Food and Drink Federation, representing food manufacturers said food price inflation was due to rising costs for ingredients and energy, as well as \"regulatory costs\" including packaging taxes and rising National Insurance. Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown said:  \"If you're wondering what that warm breeze is, it's the entire country heaving a sigh of relief at the news that inflation has fallen for the first time since March.\" Lower inflation could also help borrowers, including mortgage holders, if interest rates were to fall, she said. The Bank of England keeps borrowing rates higher if there is concern that prices are rising rise too quickly. With inflation proving \"sticky\" at 3.8% over the last few months the Bank opted at its November meeting to hold interest rates at 4%. Lower interest rates should help boost growth, another of the chancellor's stated priorities. Rob Wood chief UK economist at research firm Pantheon Macroeconomics said he believed a December interest rate cut was now \"nailed-on\" but predicted \"a lengthy delay until another cut\" following that. The Bank of England will have its eye on underlying core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, and services inflation as better indicators of the speed of future price rises. Both core and services inflation eased in October, raising hopes that inflation may now be on a downward trend. At the last interest rate meeting earlier this month,the Bank saidit judged inflation had peaked in September, without reaching the 4% pinnacle it had originally forecast. However, the longer term outlook for prices will depend on multiple factors, including the cost of energy and commodities which are affected by global developments and the changing climate. Policies in the forthcoming Budget could also affect inflation. Speculation  has included the suggestion the chancellor could cut taxes on energy bills to help bring down inflation. Spending cuts or tax rises could also have a deflationary impact. Shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride said: \"Inflation has been above target every single month since Labour's last Budget, leaving working people worse off.\" Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said the chancellor \"mustn't look this small gift horse in the mouth\" and called for \"emergency measures to slash people's energy bills\" and a VAT cut for the hospitality sector."}

The hard part for her was doing so without also increasing calories. \"So I started trying to find high-protein alternatives to things I was already consuming,\" she explains. This included yogurt, milk, coffee, cereal and pasta. \"I realized that everything tasted pretty much the same to me, and I started then actively seeking these products.\" So she was excited when a Canadian restaurant chain introduced high-protein lattes earlier this year. Andie, who did not want to give her surname, drinks them without sweetener, and describes it as a \"decent\" product. Living in Vancouver, Andie says prices are already quite high. \"High protein is usually a couple of dollars extra, so it's not a big difference.\" Like Andie, you may have noticed on supermarket shelves and restaurant menus a high-protein craze sweeping the food sector. Surveys show consumers increasingly care about the protein content of their food. In the US between March 2024 and March 2025, there was 4.8% volume growth in sales of products labelling themselves as protein-rich, compared to the previous year, according to research group NielsenIQ. Milk has been one beneficiary of the protein craze. Last year saw the first increase in milk consumption since 2009, according to data from theUS Department of Agriculture. That's partly being attributed to the enthusiasm for protein. The so-called back-to-cow movement includes products like bovine colostrum, the protein-rich milk cows produce soon after giving birth. The protein trend has been especially driven by the expanded availability of protein from whey, typically a by-product of cheese production. Whey protein is a billion-dollar sector that continues to grow. While dairy is doing well, plant-based alternatives to dairy products are going through some lean times. The sales volume of milk alternatives has started to decline, mainly driven by lower consumption in the Americas. Almond milk especially is losing market share. Slowing sales are reflected in slowing chatter online. While US searches for \"oat milk\" outnumbered Google searches for \"whole milk\" in 2020, in 2025, that has reversed. People are searching more for various types of cow milk now than ever before. One reason is the perceived naturalness of foods from cows, including collagen and beef tallow. According to NielsenIQ, milk's global market value is almost eight times larger than that of milk alternatives ($69.3bn; £50.8bn, compared with $8.4bn; £6.2bn). Milk's market value is also growing much faster. Plant-based manufacturers are responding to the demand for high-protein drinks by mentioning protein more on their packaging, and reformulating their products to include more protein. Nutritionists are often frustrated by the fervour over protein. They point out again and again that most residents of rich countries already consume more protein than they need. The exceptions may be for certain groups, including the severely malnourished, the elderly, women going through menopause, and people with chronic inflammatory conditions. Federica Amati is a research fellow at the School of Public Health at Imperial College London. She is also the head nutritionist for the nutrition company Zoe. Dr Amati worries that \"people are being hoodwinked into thinking 'high protein' on a label necessarily means that it is healthy. Honestly, it's another health halo.\" While excess consumption of protein is not likely to harm most people's health, \"consuming more protein than your body can use during midlife is linked to an increased risk of multiple diseases, including cancer,\" Dr Amati warns. \"An important point on this, though, is that plant-based sources of protein don't seem to increase cancer risk.\" And because most people don't have unlimited money to spend on food, high-protein products could be an unhelpful distraction. \"The price of fresh whole foods is going up so shoppers are best off buying more whole foods, and the standard already high-whey natural Greek yogurt without the markup,\" Dr Amati comments. \"And remember, most of us can get plenty of the protein we need if we're eating enough whole foods.\" If anything should be seen as a hero nutrient, according to many nutritionists, it should be fibre rather than protein. Dr Amati believes: \"The popularity of high-protein products in general is entirely due to marketing. Manufacturers can easily [and cheaply] add extra protein to their products and whack the price up.\" Businesses are responding to that demand. At French start-up Verley a gleaming row of stainless steel tanks, called fermentors, hold special microorganisms being fed on sugars. Eventually they'll produce beta-lactoglobulin, a protein found in whey. The team at Verley, a French startup, will then purify the protein, including extracting the lactose. The end result is a high-protein powder that is essentially dairy, but which Verley says is suitable for vegans as no cows are involved. The process is both traditional and cutting-edge, believes Stéphane Mac Millan, Verley's CEO. On the one hand, fermentation has a long history in French food culture, including in cheesemaking. On the other hand, Verley wants to modernise dairy by honing the nutritional benefits while reducing the environmental impacts. Dairy production requires large amounts of water and land, while generating large amounts of greenhouse gases. \"A goal really is to help the dairy industry move into the 21st century,\" Mr Mac Millan says. Mr Mac Millan is betting that nutrition-conscious consumers will care increasingly not only about getting enough whey protein, but about getting specific forms of it. He says that some US consumers are now seeking out beta-lactoglobulin, which is high in the amino acid leucine, rather than non-specific whey protein. The increasing number of people using weight-loss injections could also help drive the company's growth, Mr Mac Millan believes. People concerned about rapidly losing muscle might reach for high-protein products. He acknowledges that Verley's protein will be more expensive than whey protein initially. \"But considering that we are bringing more to the table and we are sustainable, it's normal that there is a premium.\" The company is also hoping to bring costs down with greater scale. It is currently seeking regulatory approval in various countries. Overall, when it comes to nutrition, the general public is more likely to listen to friends, families and influencers than to experts like him, acknowledges Jack Bobo, executive director of the Rothman Family Institute for Food Studies at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). This is partly related to the aspirational nature of much fitness content on social media, particularly targeting young men. Most viewers and listeners are not elite athletes, but many are seeking to eat and drink as if they were. One difficulty is that consumers are somewhat fickle. Soymilk is among the cheapest and highest-protein alternative milks, yet it has lost ground to the newcomers even as the protein craze has intensified. And social media moves faster than the people making or regulating food. For the time being, it seems to be smart business to focus on protein - whether it's truly beneficial or not."}

Meta, which owns the three brands, said it had begun notifying users it believes to be between 13 and 15 years old by text, email and in-app messages that their accounts would start being deactivated from 4 December. The ban in Australia comes into force on 10 December. It affects a number of platforms which also include TikTok, YouTube, X and Reddit. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the \"world-leading\" ban was aimed at \"letting kids be kids\". Meta and other firms oppose the measure but said they would comply. Australia's internet regulator has estimated there are 150,000 Facebook users and 350,000 teens on Instagram in the 13-15 age bracket. From 4 December, children aged below 16 will not be able to create accounts on Meta's social media platforms. The company said it was asking young users to update their contact details so they could be notified when they became eligible to open an account. They can download and save their posts, videos and messages before their accounts are shut down. Meta said that teens who said they were old enough to use Instagram, Facebook and Threads could challenge the restriction by taking a \"video selfie\" to be used in facial age scans. They could also provide a driver's licence or other government issued-ID. All these verification methods were tested by the UK-based Age Check Certification Scheme (ACCS) earlier this year, in a report commissioned by the Australian state. While the ACCS said that all methods had their merits, it added: \"We did not find a single ubiquitous solution that would suit all use cases, nor did we find solutions that were guaranteed to be effective in all deployments.\" Social media platforms which fail to take \"reasonable steps\" to block under-16s face fines of up to A$50m (£25m). \"While we are working hard to remove all users who we understand to be under the age of 16 by 10 December, compliance with the law will be an ongoing and multi-layered process,\" Antigone Davis, vice-president and global head of safety at Meta, told Reuters Financial. Meta wants to see a law where under-16s have to get parental approval before they download a social media app. The firm told Australia's Seven News: \"Teens are resourceful, and may attempt to circumvent age assurance measures to access restricted services.\" But it said: \"We're committed to meeting our compliance obligations and are taking the necessary steps to comply with the law.\" Australia's e-Safety Commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, said the ban was aimed at proctecting teens \"from pressures and risks they can be exposed to while logged in to social media accounts\". In a move seemingly to avoid being included in the ban, gaming platform Roblox this week announced that children under 16 would be unable to chat to adult strangers. Mandatory age checks will be introduced for accounts using chat features, starting in December for Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands, then the rest of the globe from January. The e-safety commissioner has published a list of which social media platforms will be impacted by the age ban."}

John McGinn spoke of the emotional torment of an epic night at Hampden. Craig Gordon reflected on his lengthy injury woes. And Lewis Ferguson was thinking of his wee girl on her birthday. The Scotland players talked, and talked, and talked after sealing a place in the men's World Cup for the first time since 1998 with a scarcely believable 4-2 victory over group favourites Denmark. Scott McTominay scored one of - if not - the greatest Scotland goals ever, while Kieran Tierney and Kenny McLean both struck beauties of their own in injury time to seal one of the great wins at the national stadium. Wild celebrations followed those two strikes and continued long past the final whistle as players and fans contributed to joyous scenes in Glasgow's southside. But how did Scotland's heroes sum it all up in the immediate aftermath? Scotland qualify for first men's World Cup in 28 years 'Scotland cash in almost 30 years of glorious failure as dreams come true' How Scotland's bizarre but glorious campaign unfolded 'I've been in bits - I couldn't get Jota out of my head' Scotland captain Andy Robertsonpaid tribute to former Liverpool team-mate Diogo Jota, who died last summer in a road traffic accident. \"I've hid it well, but today I've been in bits,\" the 31-year-old said. \"I know the age I'm at, this could be my last chance to go to the World Cup. \"I couldn't get my mate Diogo Jota out of my head today. We spoke so much about going to the World Cup because he missed the last one with Portugal and I did with Scotland. I know he'll be smiling over me today. \"I'm so glad it's ended up this way. This group of boys, this group of staff - it's the best group I've been involved in. \"The manager's speech before the game was unbelievable. He went through the big moments we've had. Qualifying for the Euros - he couldn't quite remember - we were in Wunderbar. He said 'let's make it another one'. \"We were quite emotional. To do it for him, the staff and all our families, it'll go down as one of the greatest nights of my life. \"That just sums up this squad. Never say die. We just keep going right to the end and one of the craziest games. We put the country through it, but I'm sure it's worth it. We're going to the World Cup. And, addressing BBC Scotland anchor Kelly Cates, Robertson added: \"I can't wait to get back down to Liverpool to have a red wine with yer da.\" 'I was thinking about the play-offs in the 91st minute' Scotland midfielder John McGinndescribed the displays in the last international break as \"jobby\" performances and conceded that this wasn't all that much better. But the end more than justified the means. \"I thought we were pretty rubbish to be honest, but who cares?\" he said. \"To get over the line was such an amazing feeling. The gaffer's team talk was exceptional. \"It's a privilege every time we meet up. It's just humble guys wanting to do well for their country. We left everything out there. \"You think that's it - glorious failure, another blow. I was thinking about the play-offs in the 91st minute. But then what a hit from KT - I will never feel like that in a football stadium ever again.\" 'This is for everyone' - Gordon Scotland goalkeeper Craig Gordonmade his Scotland debut in May 2004 - more than 21 years ago - and will be 43 by the time the World Cup rolls around. \"What a crazy night,\" he said. \"The quality of some of those goals, I don't think we'll see in another 20 years. \"I've been playing for 21 years with the national team. To go through all that and end with a night like that, incredible. \"They are a very good team, but to score four goals like that and to reach a World Cup with a goal from our own half in the last minute, you would never imagine that. \"It's emotional to think about. It's been an awful long time coming and it's incredible to be a part of it and it will take a while to sink it. I nearly retired in the summer and Steve Clarke was the one who told me to give it one more year. \"That is worth everything. All the hard work, all the disappointments.\" Scotland were heading for the play-offs until substituteTierneycurled a magnificent shot beyond the despairing dive of Denmark goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel in the 93rd minute. \"It's mental, man,\" the Celtic defender said. \"One of the best feelings ever. This group, the staff, everyone deserves it. Too good to be true, honestly. I don't know what I did for my celebration. What a night.\" AndMcLeancapped the evening off by lobbing Denmark goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel from inside his own half, having come off the bench to replace the injured Ben Gannon-Doak in the first half. \"The atmosphere in here, the whole place deserves it,\" he said. \"It's been a long time. We knew we had the ability to do it, but to do it late on feels a bit more special. \"The finish, KT just said 'you scored the third best goal of the game and it was a belter'. \"I thought about [shooting] twice. The keeper didn't drop too quickly so I took a pop. To see it go in that inside post, it's the best feeling I've had. It tops Norway.\" Ferguson shares special birthday moment with daughter Tuesday was already a special day for midfielderLewis Fergusonbefore the events at Hampden. \"It's my daughter's third birthday today and I was a wee bit gutted I didn't get to spend it with her, but it was all worth it to see her at the end,\" he said. \"I'm so happy and so proud. It will probably sink in tomorrow when we're all hungover. I've grown up never seeing Scotland at a major tournament, never at a World Cup, but we've topped the group.\" 'This game will be remembered forever. It had everything'"}

Speaking to the BBC World Service for the Global Women series, Cho, 40, is describing her childhood in Texas, as the eldest daughter of Korean immigrant parents and her struggle for acceptance in American society. In the film, which tells the story of a female K-Pop trio who must save the world from evil forces, Rumi has to come to terms with her identity as part human, part demon - and when Cho first read the script this resonated powerfully. \"Being born in America, feeling American but having people treat me like I'm not, trying to figure out my identity as an Asian-American, as a Korean-American, as a woman,\" she says. These were all elements of her early life that mirrored Rumi's journey. \"I can honestly say that at different points in my life, I hated a lot of myself and I wanted to be someone else. \"As kids, what you see shapes who you become and I feel like I just didn't see enough people that look like me.\" When it launched on Netflix in June, KPop Demon Hunters registered 33 million views in just two weeks, and reached the top 10 of the Netflix charts in 93 countries. To star in the first Hollywood animated film set in Korea, with Korean leads, was for Cho \"a dream come true\" – but it has also made her a powerful role model for Asian-American children, of the kind that she lacked when she was young. Cho says many Korean-Americans have told her it's \"such a refreshing moment\", making them proud for the first time of their dual heritage and culture. \"I feel like K-Pop really, truly, has paved the way. K-beauty has had such a big impact on Korea being loved. But I feel like this movie is the one that tipped it over the edge of, everybody wants to go to Korea, now,\" Cho says. But the film's success was not guaranteed and Cho says she felt the team making it were \"sometimes facing an uphill battle\". \"I feel like it kind of sucks to say this, but any time there's an Asian-led project, people feel like it's a risk,\" she says. So, when she took on the role, she made an effort to meet everyone working on the film in person, she says. The film was released against the backdrop of increased immigration raids in the US as part of the Trump administration's mass deportation effort, targeting those who are in the country illegally, which sparked protests in many states. As an Asian-American living in the US \"it's heartbreaking and disappointing,\" says Cho. \"Immigrants have made America what it is.\" Korean news sources have estimated that up to 150,000 Korean immigrants without proper documentation, including adopted children, are among those who could be deported. As an adult, Cho came to realise that the racism she had experienced when she was younger stemmed mainly from a lack of education, as people didn't know what it meant to be Korean or Asian. \"But now in this day and age, when I feel like the world and people should know better, it is beyond disappointing and sometimes I feel like we feel so hopeless,\" she says. Because of this, it feels very special, she says, that KPop Demon Hunters could bring \"hope and joy and love to all these different communities\". \"Maybe that's why it's sort of like this movie of the summer, because we just needed some hope and something to unite us all together.\" The growth of AI is a major concern for the film industry, raising the possibility that in future it could be used to make a film like KPop Demon Hunters. Cho says she is aware that AI is already being used to replicate actors' voices, but wants to \"have hope in humanity\" that people will still seek out art created by humans. \"Sure, I'm sure they're going to have AI actors and singers. I know they already exist. I know our voices are already being manipulated, but I hope people have some respect and want and love for something real.\" KPop Demon Hunters has also been dominating the global music charts, with seven tracks from its soundtrack featured on the Billboard Hot 100. It has its own fan art, and audiences around the world are demanding a sequel. Cho tells us she wishes she could answer the question of whether that will happen - but both she and fans will have to wait for Netflix or Sony Pictures Entertainment, which made the film, to give it the green light. \"I know there's lots of murmurs, I've heard wonderful things,\" she says. \"So we shall see, and I think everyone in the world would riot if there wasn't.\""}

In six weeks, their son Leo will have to leave his current childcare provider after he turns three years old. They are one of a growing number of families struggling to find childminder or nursery places, with many childminders now saying they can no longer afford to take on three- and four-year-olds because of lower government funding rates for older pre-school children. Overall, the number of childminders is falling too, with one charity warning that there could be none left by 2033. The government says childminders can use funding flexibly - not just for a particular age group - and that \"many could benefit from growing demand for places\". But mum Monika, a quantity surveyor based near Milton Keynes, said she had \"no idea how difficult it would be\" to find a new place for their son. \"After the tenth 'no' from a nursery or childminder, I broke down,\" she said. The couple, who contactedYour Voice, Your BBC Newsto share their story, thought the government funded hours were \"a Godsend\". But Henry says it only works when there are spaces available. \"If the childminders don't feel they're getting adequately compensated, then it gets pushed back onto the parents. We don't have family around and we're really at our wits' end.\" Although the family has now secured a potential place for Leo in January, it is only for three days a week - meaning they are now having to discuss flexible work arrangements with their employers. The number of childminders has been falling for a decade, from almost 48,000 in 2015 to 25,000 in 2025, new Ofsted figures suggest. There were 1,000 fewer childminders in 2025 than in 2024, a fall of 4%. It comes at a time when demand is rising, as more working parents are now eligible for30 government-funded hours of childcare for children from nine months oldduring term time in England. Hundreds of childminders say they are now restricting or opting out of caring for three- and four-year-olds, according to a survey by Coram PACEY, the Professional Association for Childcare and Early Years. Ka Lai Brightley-Hodges, head of the charity, says those childminders would want to offer those places if it was \"properly funded\". That would allow them to offer continuous care from nine months old all the way through to school age, she said. In her home in Carlton in Yorkshire, childminder Georgina Young makes gingerbread men with two four-year-olds she has cared for since they were babies. \"I am running at a loss, the funding is less than I would normally get an hour,\" she says. \"There is not another job out there where you work really, really hard and you are rewarded with a pay cut.\" Judy Wylde, who lives on the Wirral, says the rate paid for three- and four-year-olds is \"atrocious\". She has been childminding for 35 years and spends a lot of her time in play centres, the museum and the library. She says she saves so she can cover the shortfall when they reach three years old. That's because the amount the government pays for older pre-school children is less than for children under two. Both Judy and Georgina believe the funding for the government's expansion has left childminders behind in comparison to nurseries, as they work with different staff-to-child ratios. Some rules for childminders have been relaxed. They can now work from community or village halls, and the total number of people allowed to work together has increased. But Judy and Georgina want to see further changes - including the rule that says childminders cannot be related to the children they care for. Next year, Judy won't be able to continue looking after her grandson Louie, because his parents will qualify for government-funded hours. \"It irritates the life out of me,\" she says. \"I have an amazing bond with Louie, but I cannot do it as a freebie. He is taking up a space and this is my only income since my husband passed away.\" Georgina similarly says she would love to look after her nephew, who turns one next week, but she cannot afford to do it for free. \"My sister's had to start looking at childcare options and she was really upset, because obviously she wanted to send him to me.\" The issues are affecting both childminders and parents alike. Childcare spaces overall increased by 1% in 2025 – mainly due to the expansion of private nurseries and preschools. But the government has admitted parents may not get their first choice. For Kirstie Osborne, the lack of spaces is a real concern. The mum-of-two was made redundant while on maternity leave. Many of the jobs she's eligible for require her to start immediately, or within three months. But the earliest nursery space she can find near where she lives in the West Midlands is for September 2026. \"Now I am frozen out of even applying for jobs,\" she says. \"It's like you can't get back in, the door is shut and locked.\" A government spokesperson said ministers were \"backing the sector with £8bn in funding this year\" and said the early years workforce had \"grown significantly\". Childminders provide \"flexible, high-quality care that families value\", they added."}

Speaking at a conference of business leaders in Singapore, Mr Muñoz said the governor of Georgia had also called him and said \"I don't know what happened, this is not state jurisdiction.\" In September,more than 300 South Korean workers were detainedin a raid at a battery plant operated by Hyundai and electronics giant LG, raising tensions between Washington and Seoul. The BBC has contacted the White House and the governor of Georgia for comment. During the raid, workers were forced to sit on the floor of the factory as officers shackled their legs in scenes that sparked outrage in South Korea. The workers were held in detention for more than a week before being flown homeafter the South Korean government held urgent talks with the US. The company warned in September that the raid would delay the plant's opening due to labour shortages. Mr Muñoz said during a panel discussion at the Bloomberg New Economy Forum that he believed that someone had \"made a phone call and made it look like there were illegal immigrants\" at the plant. \"That's absolutely not the case,\" said Mr Muñoz. The raid was \"a bad surprise\" but the company remained committed to manufacturing in the US, he added. US President Donald Trump has previously said that he was \"very much opposed\" to the raid. Trump said at the time that the US had an \"understanding\" with the world on the need to bring in experts to set up specialised facilities and train local workers. Despite the raid increasing tensions between the US and South Korea, the two countries announced in Octoberthat they had reached a broad trade deal. Under the agreement, the two sides reduced reciprocal tariffs from 25% to 15%, while South Korea said it would invest $350bn (£266.5bn) in the US."}

Summers said in a statement to the BBC that he was \"grateful for the opportunity to have served, excited about the potential of the company, and look forward to following their progress\". Summers, who was also once the president of Harvard University, said on Monday that he would be stepping back from public commitments over his ties to Epstein. The recently released emails showed Summers communicated with Epstein until the day before Epstein's 2019 arrest for the alleged sex trafficking of minors. In a statement, the artificial intelligence company said it respected Summers' decision to resign. \"We appreciate his many contributions and the perspective he brought to the Board,\" OpenAI said. The news comes after both chambers of Congress agreed on Tuesday to pass a measure to require the US justice department to release its files on Epstein. The measure will then head to the desk of US President Donald Trump for approval. He has said he plans to sign the bill, after reversing his position on the issue following pushback from his supporters. A batch of Epstein-related emails released by the House Oversight Committee last week mentioned a number of high-profile figures in the financier's former circle, without indicating any legal wrongdoing by those figures. The emails indicated that Summers and Epstein dined together frequently, with Epstein often trying to connect Summers to prominent global figures. After the emails were shared with the public, Summers said he took \"full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr Epstein\". He added that he wanted \"to rebuild trust and repair relationships with the people closest to me\". Summers held senior posts under two Democratic presidents; serving as treasury secretary under Bill Clinton, and as director of the National Economic Council under Barack Obama. He led Harvard from 2001 to 2006 and remains a professor there. When announcing his step-down from public commitments earlier on Monday, he said he would continue his teaching commitments. Following Summers' announcement on Monday, the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank in Washington where Summers was a senior fellow, confirmed that Summers was no longer affiliated with the organisation. Summers joined the board of OpenAI, which makes ChatGPT, in 2023 - following a failed attempt to oust its chief executive Sam Altman."}

Chloe McGee, 23, and Shay Duffy, 21, both from Carrickmacross, County Monaghan; Alan McCluskey, 23, from Drumconrath, County Meath; Dylan Commins, 23, from Ardee, County Louth, and Chloe Hipson, 21, from Lanarkshire in Scotlandwere killed near Dundalk on Saturday. The two-vehicle crash happened on the Ardee Road at Gibstown. The vigils took place at three gaelic football grounds in counties Louth, Meath and Monaghan on Tuesday evening, with people gathering for prayers and remembrance. Reporting from Drumconrath: Catherine Morrison Several hundred people gathered in the grounds of Drumconrath GFC to remember all those who died in the weekend's accident, but particularly Alan McCluskey who was from the village. Alan was an underage player and the club's flag is at half mast. This is a small village and all of those who gathered tonight will have known Alan or his family. They are a farming family and Alan was remembered as a very hard worker and a good friend to many. A book of condolence has been opened and candles were given to people as they arrived in the cold and dark to grieve together, offer support and solidarity to all the families affected. There was music and a decade of the rosary was said. It was a solemn and moving vigil and a time to remember all of those who have been affected by this tragedy. Patricia Dunne attended the vigil to remember Alan McCluskey, who was her son's friend. She said: \"We're just in deep shock,\" adding that he was a \"lovely\" young man. \"He had the rest of his life in front of him, he should have had; it's so sad.\" Ms Dunne said Alan was a \"hard worker\". \"Any night he'd stay, the next morning he'd be up by eight o'clock to go back to his farm to do his duties.\" Paul Carey, the chairman of Drumconrath GFC, said the club held the vigil as a \"mark of solidarity\" and to have a \"place for everyone to come and meet up and show some respect for the families\". He said it's \"unimaginable\" what the families are going through and added that the community is in \"a state of shock\". Speaking before the vigil, he said: \"We're going to remember all five of the victims, in particular our own neighbour. \"Alan would have played football when he was here at an underage level, so it's particularly a remembrance for the whole McCluskey family.\" \"It's a small village and a little community, so everyone kind of knows each other, so everyone would know Alan,\" he added. Elsewhere, at Sean McDermotts gaelic football club in Ardee, County Louth, candles in the shape of a heart flickered on the ground, as another vigil was held. Ardee was home to Dylan Commins, who was a friend of Alan McCluskey. Another vigil was held in County Monaghan on Tuesday evening, at Aughnamullen gaelic football club, the home club of Chloe McGee. Photographs and candles were placed in the stand of the club grounds, during the vigil, with hundreds of people on the pitch paying their respects. On Tuesday evening, Gardaí (Irish police) said they were continuing to investigate all the circumstances of the crash. They added that post-mortem examinations have now been completed. \"The remains of Chloe, Dylan, Alan, Chloe and Shay have now been released to their families, and are being returned to their localities,\" gardaí said in a statement. Three other people - two men and a woman - were treated for non-life-threatening injuries, following the two-vehicle crash. \"The sixth occupant of the Volkswagen Golf, a male in his 20s, has been discharged from hospital,\" gardai added. \"The two occupants of the other vehicle (Toyota Landcruiser), a male and a female in their 20s, remain in hospital where they continue to receive medical treatment for non-life threatening injuries.\" Gardai have again appealed for information about the crash which happened just after 21:00 local time on Saturday. Books of condolence opened to the public across County Louth on Tuesday in civic offices in Ardee, Drogheda and Dundalk. Tributeshave been paidto the five young people, following their deaths, from those who knew them. Irish President Catherine Connolly and Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Micheál Martin are also among those who have expressed their sympathy. Funerals for Alan McCluskey and Dylan Commins will be held on Friday, while Chloe McGee's is due to take place on Saturday."}

FPL team of the week", "body": "Emboldened by betting against Erling Haaland with the captain's armband last gameweek with mild success, I've taken a brave, and possibly rash, step further this week - he's not even in the FPL team of the week! The theory is that Newcastle away is one of the toughest games around so it's another chance to captain a different player and perhaps get a jump on the field. Haaland has just one goal in six league and cup games against the Magpies. The Manchester City striker faces Leeds, Fulham and Sunderland in the next three weeks when most managers will captain him without a second thought. And at £14.9m, Haaland is an expensive asset to squeeze in your team - alongside £14.2m Mohamed Salah this week - if you aren't captaining him. Having both makes the rest of your team weaker, in my opinion. Let's see if this plan works or backfires badly! The team of the week is selected based on current FPL prices to fit within a £100m budget, as if you were playing a Free Hit. Don't miss our FPL special Q&A with expert Gianni Buttice, live on the BBC Sport website at 15:30 BST on Friday, 21 November. Bench Boost tips and average Joe Bench Boost tips and average Joe Captaining Joao Pedro (14 points) and a punt on Morgan Gibbs-White (10 points) were the key performances ina 45-point week- seven above the very low average score of 38. David Raya, Arsenal, keeper, £5.9m - Tottenham (h) With no fixture this week jumping out as an obvious clean sheet, why not go for the keeper from the best defence in the league. With or without the injured Gabriel, Arsenal's defence could well keep Spurs out. Thomas Frank's side have just four points from their past five games and don't seem to be firing in attack. Virgil van Dijk, Liverpool, £5.9m - Nottingham Forest (h) It's time to jump on Liverpool's favourable upcoming fixture run, starting with a home game against a Forest side with just two points and two goals on the road this season. Malo Gusto, Chelsea, £4.9m - Burnley (a) This Chelsea defence has three clean sheets in its past four games and will fancy another at Burnley. The Clarets haven't been too bad attacking wise, scoring 14 times so far. They failed to find the net against Spurs, Liverpool and Arsenal, but did manage goals against Manchester City and Manchester United. So it feels like a 50-50 chance of a clean sheet here, but Gusto also has a lot of attacking potential - demonstrated by his goalscoring 15-pointer in the last gameweek. Marco Senesi, Bournemouth, £5m - West Ham (h) Senesi now has defensive contribution points (defcon) in eight of 11 games this season. West Ham come into this game off the back of two straight wins, home to Newcastle and Burnley, but I'm not convinced they have suddenly turned a corner. Bournemouth, though, will want a strong home performance following the humiliation away at Aston Villa last time out. Joachim Andersen, Fulham, £4.5m - Sunderland (h) Another budget defcon magnet in a home game. Sunderland are flying high in fourth place, but have only scored three times in five away league games. Andersen is also due an attacking return - his expected goals (xG) is 0.48 this season and expected assists (xA) 0.97. Yet he has nothing to show for it. Mohamed Salah (captain), Liverpool, £14.2m - Nottingham Forest (h) Salah has had a disappointing season, no doubt about that. But there are still plenty of signs in his underlying data that we might see some of the old Salah soon. No player has created more big chances than his five and he is joint fourth for the most chances created (21). He's also joint third for shots (27) and shots in the box (23). Only four goals and two assists after 11 games is not a lot to show for things, but consider three more points: Liverpool start a juicy fixture run, starting with Forest at home. They've just had an international break for boss Arne Slot to work on turning their poor form around. And it's Mo blooming Salah - past performances say he will come good at some point. Target Liverpool, go four at back - FPL tips to kick-start your season Bruno Fernandes, Manchester United, £8.9m - Everton (h) Here's a man with even better stats than Salah. Fernandes has a consistent chance of defcon (he has only got fewer than eight points once this season) and, without his two missed penalties, he'd be close to Antoine Semenyo as the top midfielder. Just a very consistent FPL choice with free-kicks and penalties in his locker. United have scored 11 goals in their four home wins this season, have a top-five attack and should score at least a couple against Everton. Benjamin Sesko's injury might mean Fernandes plays a more advanced role against Everton as well. Bryan Mbeumo, Manchester United, £8.5m - Everton (h) We're going all in on United's attack this week and Mbeumo is the obvious second choice. He has four goals and an assist in his past five games and is top three among midfielders for shots, shots on target, big chances and shots in the box. Sesko's absence could see him play at centre-forward too. Antoine Semenyo, Bournemouth, £8.1m - West Ham (h) The star of the season so far has now had four duff games in a row - 4, 3, 2 and zero points. He only had six shots in those games, including a missed penalty. But a home game against the second-worst defence in the league - 23 goals conceded - is the time for Semenyo to bounce back. If not, owners - and that is nearly 64% of FPL managers - might be right to be worried. Keep an eye on Semenyo's ankle injury that forced him out of Ghana's recent game - Marcus Tavernier (£5.5m) is a decent budget back-up choice. Yankuba Minteh, Brighton, £6m - Brentford (h) Minteh might be the best £6m midfield option in the game. He's got more assists than any other midfielder - five along with Mohammed Kudus - and, if you've watched any of his recent games, he's left a fair few points on the pitch, with missed chances and nearly-assists. His xG for example is 2.1 yet he only has one goal. Players tend to outperform their xG over a season. Brentford are in cracking form, but they've also conceded two goals per game away from home. Joao Pedro, Chelsea, £7.7m - Burnley (a) In Haaland's absence, one man leads the line this week. Joao Pedro has two goals in two league games and I'm backing Chelsea's attacking prowess to overcome Burnley's stubborn home defence. The Clarets are a head scratcher - they've let in just four goals at home but 18 in six away games. That will surely even out a bit. Senne Lammens, Manchester United, keeper, £5m - Everton (h) Adrien Truffert, Bournemouth, defender, £4.5m - West Ham (h) Lukas Nmecha, Leeds, striker, £5m - Aston Villa (h) Marc Guiu, Chelsea, striker, £4.2m - Burnley (a) Get news, insight and fan views on your Premier League team All your football quizzes in one place"}

The spending spree - worth £45bn ($59bn) at 2023 prices - was at its height following a 2015 Chinese state directive, aimed at making the country a global leader in high-tech industries. The UK has been the top destination among G7 nations for these investments, relative to the size of its population and economy, according to US-based research group AidData. Panorama has investigated how this led to cutting-edge technology and skills being transferred to China. The UK was \"far too free in allowing access to strategically important industries\", according to a former head of GCHQ. The BBC was given exclusive early access to data collected by AidData, a research group at William & Mary, a university in the US state of Virginia. A leading specialist in tracking how governments spend money overseas, AidData receives funding from governments and charitable foundations around the world. Some government-backed Chinese investments were purely commercial but others were in line with Beijing's strategic objectives, according to Dr Brad Parks, AidData's executive director. These objectives were laid out by China's communist leaders in a strategic plan 10 years ago, called \"Made In China 2025\". It set ambitious targets for the country to become the industry leader in 10 high-tech sectors, including aerospace, electric vehicles and robotics. This was a far-sighted strategy, according to Prof Keyu Jin of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology: \"It's the longer-term strategic thinking that China has always had, and I'd argue that many other countries also should have.\" With access to AidData's research, the BBC has investigated how the purchase of some UK companies has led to technology with military potential to be transferred to China. Imagination Technologies, a Hertfordshire-based firm, was one of the companies Panorama looked at. It specialises in semiconductor design - in other words, designing the tiny electronic circuits inside chips that power devices such as computers and smartphones. In 2017, Imagination had recently lost its most important client, Apple, and had seen its share price fall dramatically. It was snapped up for £550m by a private equity firm, Canyon Bridge, based at that time in the US state of California. The Canyon Bridge fund that bought Imagination had one investor - Yitai Capital, whose largest stakeholder is China Reform. This organisation reports to the State Council, the body responsible for carrying out party policies and laws. Two months before Canyon Bridge bought Imagination in the UK, it had tried to buy a semiconductor company in the US. However, that purchase had been blocked by the US's investment-screening laws. The value of Imagination lay in its intellectual property - the expertise of its engineers, amassed over decades. A potential buyer would be buying into this expertise. What is more, the algorithms behind its technology, although developed for other products, could be put to military use in missiles and drones. In his first interview since leaving Imagination, the company's former CEO, Ron Black, says the UK government vetted the deal, and he was told \"unequivocally\" by Canyon Bridge that China Reform would be a passive investor, only interested in making money. However, in 2019, Mr Black says he was summoned to a meeting in Beijing, where he was asked to work directly for China Reform, and oversee the wholesale transfer of Imagination's technology and expertise to China. \"I think [the China Reform representative] said specifically 'from the heads of the British engineers to the Chinese engineers, then lay off the British engineers and you'll make a lot of money',\" says Mr Black. He refused, but he says that several months later, China Reform tried to install four new directors \"with no understanding of semiconductors\" directly onto the board of Imagination Technologies. \"The only attributes they appeared to have was a relationship with China Reform,\" he adds. Convinced that Imagination's technology had the capacity to be used for military purposes, Mr Black began reaching out to contacts in the UK government. He says he was given a sympathetic hearing, but was told this was a private industry matter, and there was not much anyone could do. Fearful about the possible transfer of military-grade technology, Mr Black resigned. At that point, he says, the UK government started to take an interest, and China Reform halted its attempt to install new directors. Mr Black withdrew his resignation but was fired three days later. He was later found by an employment tribunal to have been unfairly dismissed. After he left the company, Imagination's homegrown technology was transferred to China. According to Imagination, its technology is not used in military products. It told Panorama: \"Imagination has always complied with applicable export and trade compliance laws in respect of its commercial licensing of semiconductor IP technology and related transactions.\" Canyon Bridge told Panorama \"the Imagination transaction was sourced and led exclusively by Canyon Bridge and its advisers\". Panorama contacted China Reform, but it has not commented on Mr Black's allegations. The Chinese Embassy says its government \"has always required Chinese enterprises operating overseas to strictly comply with local laws and regulations\" and that these enterprises \"also contribute actively to local economic growth, social development and job creation - efforts that have been widely welcomed by many countries\". In 2017, the UK had fewer powers to stop the sale of a company such as Imagination to Chinese owners. Two years earlier, China's leader, Xi Jinping, had been welcomed on a state visit, with David Cameron's Conservative government hailing the start of a \"golden era\" in China-UK relations. \"We thought China was basically a very friendly power and there was lots of money to be made,\" says Sir Jeremy Hunt. In 2015 he was health secretary, and later held other government posts, including chancellor of the exchequer and foreign secretary. \"But under the surface, we were beginning to sense a much more assertive China.\" The challenge of how to trade with China, while keeping the UK safe, remains an unresolved issue. \"This is the trillion-dollar question,\" says Sir Jeremy Fleming, a former head of GCHQ. The UK has benefited from a trading relationship with China, and from its investment, over the past couple of decades, he says. On the other hand, he adds, the UK has sometimes forgotten that this investment could be used against its own interests. \"My personal view,\" he says, \"is that we have been far too free in allowing access to strategically important industries in science and technology.\" Sir Jeremy contrasts the UK's approach with the control exerted by the Chinese: \"They have been very strategic and careful not to allow Western companies to invest or to get involved in key bits of their industry which are strategically important.\" Europe as a whole and some US businesses were naive about China in 2017-18, according to John Bolton, former US national security advisor during the first Trump administration. \"There was a reluctance to think we were slipping back into some kind of Cold War,\" he says. Mr Bolton hasrecently been indicted in the USon several charges pertaining to the alleged mishandling of classified information. He maintains his innocence. Some experts argue that Beijing did nothing wrong, and that the UK was just short-sighted. China is effectively a one-party state and some argue its autocratic system succeeds because of its long-term strategic planning. The results, seen from China's perspective, have been \"nothing short of remarkable\", says Prof Keyu Jin. \"One of the key advantages of China's political system is the ability to set multi-decade-long goals,\" she says. \"And you do the planning. You do the investment. You set the strategy. You influence the financing. It's not a five-year thing.\" In this century, China has been the world's largest overseas lender, to the tune of £1.6tn ($2.1tn) at 2023 prices, AidData's research has revealed. The high point for Chinese overseas investment was during 2016 and 2017, according to Dr Parks. After this point, he says, many countries started strengthening screening mechanisms on national security grounds. The US, Germany and Italy tightened vetting on foreign investment by 2018. The UK followed suit in 2022. Sir Jeremy Fleming is cautiously optimistic that lessons have been learned. \"We have a much stronger regime in place,\" he says. \"But would I say the process is watertight? Absolutely not.\" In 2024, a Labour government was elected, but it faced the same issue as its Conservative predecessor - namely, that the UK needed economic growth and China could help. \"One big problem in Europe, including the UK, is that there's not enough investment and funding,\" says Prof Keyu Jin. \"China is very happy to finance some of these projects. And there are lots of areas where there's no real threat of national security.\" Chancellor Rachel Reeves has already beenon a mission to Beijing to secure foreign investment. But some Labour MPs are concerned the government has not published its China audit, which it carried out as part of an election manifesto commitment. \"I was promised by the foreign secretary that it would be published,\" says Dame Emily Thornberry MP, the chair of the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee. \"Then we hear that the China audit has happened but we're not going to be told about it, we're only going to get a few lines.\" The Foreign Office has told Panorama it did not publish its full audit because of its security classification. It says it takes \"a consistent and strategic\" approach to China, the UK's third largest trading partner, it is committed to supporting UK businesses to \"trade securely\", and it will use its powers to protect UK interests."}

Taunton Town Council has said it will pay £105,000 a year for the next five years to the Taunton Brewhouse to secure its future and help with ongoing maintenance and repairs. The council stepped in after Somerset Council, the building's owner, said \"it was no longer financially sustainable\" to continue funding the venue's repairs. Vickie Robbins, executive director of the theatre said: \"The £105,000 every year will go towards making improvements to the building so that it stands for another 50 years.\" Ms Robbins said: \"We have worked very, very hard to become a fairly self-sustaining organisation but subsequent to that we also now have to take on the repairing and maintaining responsibilities for the building.\" Taunton Theatre Association (TTA), the charity which operates Taunton Brewhouse, leases the building from Somerset Council on the basis significant repairs are undertaken by the landlord, not the tenant. However, the council indicated that from 2026 future repairs and maintenance responsibilities will transfer to the tenant. The deputy leader of Taunton Town Council said there would not be an immediate rise to council tax bills as a result of the funding. Amber Packer-Hughes said: \"There is going to be no increase next year on the precept on the back of this agreement.\" She added: \"It's about more than funding, it is about safeguarding a space that really brings people together, it enriches lives and it strengthens the local economy. \"The Brewhouse puts on so many amazing events for all different sectors of society, whether it's touring ballet companies, comedians that come in, local pantomime groups, you name it, they serve absolutely everybody - It's such an important institution,\" she added. In a statement, Somerset Council said: \"It's really positive news Taunton Town Council will be supporting the Brewhouse going forward. \"The longer lease term should enable TTA to apply for other external grant funding and the council will support in identifying potential streams,\" it added.

The tournament runs from 21 December until 18 January. There has been no official announcement about which date clubs will have to release their players by - and it could vary depending on agreements. Players could miss up to six, or in some cases seven, Premier League matches - plus FA Cup and Carabao Cup games - if they reach the final. The group stages end on 31 December, so quickly eliminated players may only miss half that amount. Arsenal, Chelsea and Leeds do not have any players due to play in the 2025 Afcon - with Sunderland and Wolves losing the most players. BBC Sport looks at which teams are due to lose players. Manchester United's Bryan Mbeumo and Sunderland's Arthur Masuaku will both be expecting to go to Afcon Villa's only player at Afcon will be Ivory Coast forwardEvann Guessand. However, the 24-year-old has only started five Premier League matches - so Villa will be confident of coping without him. Like Villa, Bournemouth should not be too affected by Afcon. Attacking midfielderAmine Adliis likely to be in the Morocco squad. But the 25-year-old has started only one Premier League match since his summer arrival. Fortunately for boss Andoni Iraola, his star man Antoine Semenyo's Ghana did not qualify for the competition. Brentford will have two players going off to Afcon - including one first-team regular. Club-record signingDango Ouattarawill feature for Burkina Faso. The £42.5m forward has scored twice for the Bees. MidfielderFrank Onyeka- who has only played 88 minutes in the league this season - plays for Nigeria. Brighton must do without Cameroon midfielderCarlos Baleba, who has started nearly every game for Albion this season. Yankuba Minteh's Gambia did not qualify. Burnley will have three players at the tournament Former England Under-21 defenderAxel Tuanzebewill be playing for DR Congo at the Africa Cup of Nations. StrikerLyle Fostercould feature for South Africa, while playmakerHannibal Mejbriis in line to represent Tunisia at the tournament. The biggest blow for Crystal Palace will be the loss of Senegal wingerIsmaila Sarr, who has scored eight goals in all competitions this season. ForwardChristantus Uche, who has only featured as a substitute for Palace so far, is a Nigeria international but was not in their most recent squad. Neither Morocco defenderChadi Riadnor Mali midfielderCheick Doucourehave played a competitive game of football since January following serious knee injuries. Whoever does go will miss Palace's Carabao Cup quarter-final with Arsenal on 23 December. Everton will lose two members of their starting XI both to Senegal - four-goal forwardIliman Ndiayeand midfielderIdrissa Gueye. Young defenderAdam Aznouhas not been in a Morocco squad since his summer move from Bayern Munich to Merseyside. Beto is a Guinea-Bissau international but they did not qualify. Fulham will see three players all go off to join the Nigeria squad. MidfielderAlex Iwobiand defenderCalvin Basseyhave played every game in the league this season, while wingerSamuel Chukwuezehas only been used off the bench. Eighth-placed Liverpool will only lose one player to Afcon - but that one player is one of their greatest footballers ever. Mohamed Salah, who has scored five times so far in an underwhelming campaign, will certainly be in the Egypt squad. Title-chasing City have two players going off to Afcon, but neither have played all that much this season because of injury. Egypt forwardOmar Marmoushhas started two Premier League games, with three starts for Algeria left-backRayan Ait-Nouri. Manchester United's right-hand side will have a very different look to it over the festive period. Cameroon forwardBryan Mbeumoand two players who have featured at right wing-back - Ivory Coast'sAmad Dialloand Morocco'sNoussair Mazraoui- are all heading off next month. The only potential departure for Newcastle is a player who has yet to play for the club. DR Congo forwardYoane Wissa, a summer signing from Brentford, injured his knee on international duty in September. A return is thought to be imminent, although there are reports DR Congo will not call him up. Nottingham Forest have up to four players who will leave for Afcon - but it could be as low as one. MidfielderIbrahim Sangareis certain to be in the Ivory Coast squad, while defenderWilly Bolywill hope to be but has barely played this season - and was not in their most recent squad. Full-backOla Ainaand forwardTaiwo Awoniyiare both Nigeria internationals. But Aina has not played since hamstring surgery in September - and Awoniyi has not been in a squad this year. This season's surprise package, fourth-placed Sunderland will be the worst affected team by far by Afcon 2025 with seven players due to leave. They are Morocco wingerChemsdine Talbi, Senegal midfielderHabib Diarra, Mozambique full-backReinildo, Ivory Coast wingerSimon Adingra, Burkina Faso forwardBertrand Traoreand DR Congo pairArthur MasuakuandNoah Sadiki. The majority of them are first-team regulars, with 50 Premier League appearances between them this season. Diarra has been out since September through injury. Tottenham might have two midfielders going off to Afcon - Senegal'sPape Matar Sarrand Mali'sYves Bissouma. Bissouma has not played for Spurs this season and had ankle surgery in October. Mohammed Kudus will be available for his club because Ghana failed to qualify. Struggling West Ham will lose both of their starting full-backs for a few weeks. Right-backAaron Wan-Bissakawill link up with DR Congo, while left-backEl Hadji Malick Dioufwill play for Senegal. Wolves are bottom of the Premier League and without a win - and five players will jet off. Zimbabwe pairMarshall MunetsiandTawanda Chirewa, Ivory Coast defenderEmmanuel Agbadou,Nigeria strikerTolu Arokodareand Cameroon full-backJackson Tchatchouawill all be heading off.

We will be selling F-35 jets,\" Trump said. \"They've been a great ally.\" The leaders are expected to discuss deals on defence and civilian nuclear power during Tuesday's White House visit, the first by the de facto Saudi leader since journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed and dismembered at the hands of Saudi agents seven years ago. A US intelligence assessmentsaidPrince Mohammed approved the operation that led to the killing. The crown princedeniedany role in the murder. Prince Mohammed's last visit was during Trump's first term in 2018, the same year as Khashoggi's murder in Istanbul. While former President Joe Biden did not host the crown prince and promised to make the country a \"pariah\" over its human rights record, Bidendid visit Saudi Arabiain 2022 to reach agreements on other issues. Biden said he raised Khashoggi's murder in that meeting. Trump and the crown prince already met in Riyadh in May. There,the US agreed to sell nearly $142bn(£107bn) worth of arms to Saudi Arabia  in what the White House described as the \"largest defence sales agreement in history\", as part of a $600bn investment deal. Saudia Arabia is the largest buyer of US arms. Some American defence officials have raised concerns about a potential sale of F-35s, considered the most advanced fighter jet in the world, to Saudi Arabia. They told US media that they feared it would give Saudi Arabia access to sensitive stealth technology, which the country could then share with China under a security partnership between the two powers. Officials in Israel are also worried, telling US and local media that a deal has the potential to hurt the country's military standing. Israel is the closest US ally in the Middle East and the only country in the region with F-35s. One F-35A jet costs on average $82.5m, according to lead manufacturer Lockheed Martin. During Tuesday's meeting, Trump is also expected to push for Saudi Arabia to sign the Abraham Accords he created and normalise relations with Israel. The Saudis have said that is conditional on a path to a Palestinian state - which the current Israeli government rejects."}

He says that up until early October his company was mainly dealing with defence firms, but now it has \"completely shifted\". The small, box-like kit made by MyDefence is mostly used by the military of Nato countries and Ukraine. However lately demand has grown from civilian customers. \"It's coming from critical infrastructure,\" he adds, \"from big companies, looking to protect their own assets\". The device detects communication between the drone and its pilot, then breaks that connection, explains Mr Hermansen, by emitting a powerful radio signal on the same frequency. Rather than falling out of the sky, the drone is pushed away and has a controlled landing. If it tries to reconnect to a GPS signal, that can be blocked too, he adds. Mr Hermansen reckons that radio frequency jamming works against 80 to 90% of the drones that are flown. The use of jamming equipment and other methods tointercept drones is regulated. Using such equipment is usually limited to police or defence agencies. To disable an unauthorised drone, it's essential to be able to detect it first. \"The first part is really about identification. And the second part is an interceptor system,\" explains Kasper Hallenborg, director of The Maersk Mc-Kinney Moller Institute at University of Southern Denmark. Identifying a drone is not so easy, points out Andreas Graae, the head of research at the Institute of Military Technology at the Danish Defence Academy. \"[Drones] can be very small or really big, and are often produced from materials like plastic or fabrics that are very hard to detect on a traditional radar,\" he says. A suite of technologies are under constant development, to help find drones. That includes acoustic sensors that listen for the drone's buzzing; advanced optical cameras, with very high resolution; and increasingly sophisticated tactical radars, which work over longer ranges and can even differentiate between a drone or a bird. Once detected, a drone needs to be disabled. Electronic jamming, similar to that used by MyDefence has leapt forward, thanks in large part to the war in Ukraine. \"[Ukraine's] frontlines are totally jammed,\" Mr Graae says, which means that drone controllers lose control of their machines. So, Russia and Ukraine have adapted by using drones controlled by fibre optic cables, or using drones that can navigate autonomously, or fly along pre-programmed routes. Such drones need to be intercepted or shot down and plenty of firms are working on novel ways to do that. Among them is Swedish start-up, Nordic Air Defence. It is developing a low-cost interceptor designed to strike the targeted drone, forcing it to crash. \"It's missile shaped, so travels incredibly fast,\" he adds. \"It's incredibly easy to manufacture. It is basically 3D printed,\" says Jens Holzapfel, the company's business director. Cost is a criticial factor in countering drones. Last month, Nato Secretary-General Mark Rutte said: \"It's unacceptable to shoot down drones costing one or two thousand dollars with missiles that may cost half a million or even a million dollars.\" That's been a big lesson from Ukraine, says Mr Graae. \"It's become a competition of how cheap you can actually make a drone attack, and how expensive it is to defend against.\" \"As hostile drones become cheaper, it puts pressure on the defender to manufacture low cost products,\" agrees Mr Holzapfel. Low-cost drones are increasingly a security issue away from the frontlines of Ukraine. Poland and Romaniahad their airspace breachedby Russian drones; while separate drone incidents were reported, in Norway, Sweden, Lithuania, Romania and most recentlyat Germany's Munich airport. In Denmark tensions have also run high after a string of mysterious sightings at airports andmilitary installations aroundthe country. That spurred the defence ministry to deploy \"several capacities\" that can detect, track and jam drones; and last week Sweden announced plans to invest more than $365m (£275m) in anti-drone systems, including measures to jam and shoot them down, as well as the deployment of hunter drones. Mr Holzapfel at Nordic Air Defence currently works with Sweden and its European allies. As well as the military, clients are from law enforcement agencies and security companies. But he also sees civilian sectors like shipping and the oil and offshore industries as potential markets. In a civilian setting. simply shooting down a drone might be too risky. \"It could be rather dangerous,\" says Kasper Hallenborg, pointing to the falling parts and potentially flammable fuel. \"We saw the impact in Poland,\" he continues. \"That was just drone fragments, which more or less removed the roof of a house.\" Early detection would help, says Mr Hallenborg: \"Then you can probably take it down somewhere it's more safe to do so.\" At short ranges, shooting out nets to tangle up the drone is another method and cheap lasers are also being developed. There are also safer, so-called soft-kill options, including hacking. \"That's a more secure way to neutralize the drone, because then you can actually control the landing,\" says Mr Graae. Crucially, a traffic management system is urgently needed, suggests Mr Hallenborg, involving electronic license plates for each drone device and way for users to register the flight in advance. \"Then we can quickly identify which drones are allowed to be there and those that aren't,\" says Mr Hallenborg. \"The [Danish] police have been overloaded with people telling them about what they've seen in the sky. A lot of these drones are probably there with a [legitimate] purpose,\" he says."}

They'd found a 2021 Nissan Leaf with just 29,000 miles on it, and the dealer told them the condition of the battery, or its state of health (SOH), was still around 93%. The couple were sold. For £12,500, they got an EV with a big boot and plenty of room for passengers. Though Mr Dunstan, a cabinetmaker who also owns a somewhat snazzier electric Volvo SUV, hasn't quite fallen in love with the aging Leaf. \"I like sporty, jazzy cars – and it's just a bit 'meh',\" he says. However, he adds the Leaf has performed exactly as expected during the three months they've owned it. It used to be that age and mileage were the two headline details pored over by would-be buyers of second-hand cars. But as more people shift to electric, scrutinising the health of a car's battery has become arguably even more important. How has that battery been treated? Did the last owner regularly fast charge it to 100%, for example? Thathas the potential to shortenan EV battery's lifespan. This battery black box problemhas put some consumersoff buying a second-hand EV. But battery analytics firms say they can reveal the condition of an old EV's battery with high accuracy. And industry experts say some EVs are lasting longer than many predicted. Take Mr Dunstan's Nissan Leaf. This is a model of EV built without the kind of sophisticated, liquid-based battery cooling system common to many other EVs. While Nissanhas rectified this in the latest generationof Leafs, earlier models show a considerable shortening of their range year by year,according to dataanalysed by US insurance and research firm NimbleFins. Mr Dunstan is unfazed. \"I charge both my EVs to 100% and I put them on charge when I need to charge them – I don't worry about it,\" he says. For people in the market for a second-hand EV who are plagued by battery anxieties, however, Austria-based firm Aviloo says it has a solution. \"We really can, completely independently, determine the state of health of a battery,\" says chief product officer, Patrick Schabus. Aviloo is one of several battery analytics businesses in the market. The company, which provides battery health certificates for major UK outlet British Car Auctions, offers two products. There's a premium test, where EV owners plug a data logging box roughly the size of a glasses case into their car so that it can monitor battery performance while they use the car over a few days, going from 100% charge down to 10%. Or, they can opt for a quicker flash test, which uses a different box to suck up data from the car's battery management software and then analyse it with the help of a computer model. \"We can do this at a standstill in under two minutes,\" says Mr Schabus. The premium test observes battery discharge closely, picking up fluctuations in current or voltage, and can reveal extra detailed information about the health of individual cells in the battery, says Aviloo. Marcus Berger, Aviloo's chief executive, says his company's analytics results sometimes diverge \"substantially\" from the battery SOH percentages produced by some cars' own built-in analytics systems. He challengesconventional wisdomthat batteries with an SOH below 80% are too far gone: \"An EV with a state of health below 80% can still be a great car… It just needs to be priced [appropriately].\" In New Zealand, EV owner Lucy Hawcroft, who works in a sustainability role for an infrastructure firm, bought a Nissan Leaf with her husband roughly three years ago. She recalls getting an SOH result of 95% or so from the dealership. But a year later an independent mechanic checked the SOH again for them. \"It dropped quite a bit,\" she recalls. \"My husband was a bit surprised, or concerned, about that.\" However, the car still has a range of around 160km (100 miles) when fully charged. The pair mostly use it for short journeys of up to 10km. Mrs Hawcroft says she has friends whose EVs have much bigger ranges, of around 400km: \"That would be ideal.\" For David Smith, sales director at Cleevely Electric Vehicles in Cheltenham, being able to analyse used EVs' batteries in detail is a deal-maker. Most customers ask for this information, he says. His company uses SOH reports from ClearWatt, another battery analytics firm. \"They're completely independent. We can't interfere with the reports,\" he says. \"Once customers have seen the report, that aids the sale nine times out of 10.\" Matt Cleevely, managing director at Cleevely Electric Vehicles, adds that it's often possible to replace groups of cells or modules within a battery pack – far cheaper than installing a whole new battery. As for how you should charge your own EV in order to best take care of its battery, Simona Onori at Stanford University says, \"There is likely a sweet spot between frequent fast charging and avoiding it altogether.\" However, she adds that, to her knowledge, this is not something that has yet been thoroughly studied. Despite some consumers' wariness, battery technology has noticeably improved in recent years, says Max Reid, head of battery costs at market research firm CRU. \"The older batteries might last maybe 500 to 1,000 [charging] cycles,\" he explains. \"Now, it's 10,000 cycles in some of these new EV cells coming out.\" Batteries that are no longer good enough for the EV they were designed for can still be useful, says Paul Chaundy at Second Life EV Batteries, in Dorset. For instance, some of his customers are businesses that use former EV batteries to store electricity at their premises. They might have, say, six electric forklifts but a grid connection only large enough for charging ports to supply two or three of the forklifts. Regarding the varying methodologies car manufacturers use to generate SOH reports for their own vehicles, Mr Chaundy says, \"We need more standards around that, I think.\""}

Waste management company Biffa's Sunderland plant closed in February after opening in 2022 at a cost of £7m, while rival Viridor closed its Avonmouth plant in 2022, Skelmersdale in 2023 and confirmed this summer that its Rochester plant would close, too. Like falling dominoes, plastic recycling plant closures have been endemic across Europe too: another big name, Veolia, will close its two German operations this year, while seven plastic recyclers closed in the Netherlands last year. Meanwhile, companies Borealis, Dow and Nestehave all dropped plansto construct new plastic recycling plants in Europe. Industry body Plastic Recyclers Europe equates this to the loss of nearlyone million tonnesof plastic recycling capacity since 2023. \"Without decisive political action, Europe will replace its recycling industry with dependency on unsustainable imports and growing volumes of waste, undermining both its economic resilience and its climate leadership,\" the organisation told the BBC in a statement. And more closures are likely, warns James McLeary, managing director for Biffa's polymers division, as the industry here and in Europe faces its most challenging year yet. High energy and labour costs here are two factors, in parallel with the fact thatsourcing virgin and recycled plastic from Asiais currently cheaper than buying European recycled plastic. Plastic recycling plant closuresare affecting the US as well, also prompted by the low price of virgin plastic, causing the country to miss its recycled content targets, asS&P Global reports. \"There's a big global dependence building on Asian plants, and we then have the situation where (plant operators in the UK and Europe) are going to make very tough decisions. Either they run their plants at a point where they're literally not making anything, or they decide to close,\" explains Mr McLeary, who is based in County Durham. A dependence on exporting plastic waste also hasn't helped. The UK exported around 600,000 tonnes of plastic waste last year, according to environmental analystsat ENDS Report- 5% more than in 2023. Loopholes in current UK legislation mean plastic waste collectors are inadvertently incentivised to export rather than process domestically. Meanwhile, manufacturers using plastic packaging are still inclined to use cheaper virgin plastic from abroad, and stomach being taxed for it. Ahmed Detta, CEO and founder of plastic waste recycler Enviroo, is frustrated by the flaws and contradictions that he feels are plaguing the industry and disrupting the goal of creating a circular economy that keeps materials in use for as long as possible. \"For me, a circular economy is a win-win. Every single person in that journey has to have some benefit, and that's not working,\" says Mr Detta, who is based in London. \"Brands aren't aligning with the circular economy. They're saying, 'why should I buy recycled material when it's cheaper for me to pay the fine for the plastics packaging tax, than actually pay for recycled materials? No one is saying, 'let's unite'.\" So concerned is RECOUP, a UK-based plastic recycling independent authority, that its head of policy and infrastructure, Steve Morgan, warns: \"We are almost witnessing the demise of plastic recycling as we know it, unless we have some interventions. There's no way a lot of recyclers in the UK can compete.\" UK regulations have benefited foreign markets more than they have the UK, and serious reform is needed, Mr Morgan argues. \"There are an awful lot of fantastic technologies developing. But it's a scale up of those and how they can actually make money, to continue to exist and then also thrive, is the secondary thing,\" says Mr Morgan, who is based in Peterborough. \"The commercial viability long term is just not there at the moment. There are some really good people producing technologies that we couldn't even dream of 10 years ago. But I just feel we're not going to see any real change in the next two to three years without some intervention.\" RECOUP is urging the UK government to introduce a single plastic recycling certification scheme aimed at reducing the export of plastic waste and making more companies more inclined to use recycled packaging. Mr Morgan is optimistic that a UK government consultation this year will seriously consider what changes should be implemented to save the plastic recycling industry. Packaging reforms are indeed being implemented, alongside £10bn of investment in new plastic sorting and processing facilities, according to a spokesperson from the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA). They also say the Deposit Return Scheme, launching in October 2027, will create higher quality material for recycling, as consumers will be encouraged to return drinks bottles and cans to collection points to collect the small deposit they will have paid on purchase. The government has also convened a Circular Economy Taskforce. \"Our collection and packaging reforms will support UK-based recycling, meaning we can reduce our dependency on exports of plastic waste,\" says the spokesperson. \"The export of waste is subject to strict controls set out in UK legislation.\" Over in Brussels, Virginia Janssens is the managing director at Plastics Europe, which represents plastic producers, including those with recycling operations and that use recycled materials. She's concerned that the plastic recycling industry is set to flourish outside Europe. \"Business will go where it makes sense and where it's cheapest to build. If those big production plans are built somewhere else, with huge investments of billions, they're not all of a sudden then going to decide to go back and build one in Europe,\" says Ms Janssens. \"It will have a huge effect on our value chain. It would set us back to 20 years ago, when we would have to incinerate or use landfill more, and that would be a real shame. Nobody wants this.\" But there are some bright spots in an otherwise struggling industry. Biffa, for example, has recently acquired bottle manufacturer Esterform, which uses recycled PET. Meanwhile, Enviroo recently secured £58m to build a new recycling facility in the north-west of England, specialising in converting PET drink bottles into a recycled granulate that can be used in food packaging. Due to be operational by 2026, the plant is expected to process up to 35,000 tonnes of plastic annually. Mr Detta believes being a specialist in an industry of generalists, and going back to the fundamentals of plastic recycling, will be his key to success. \"I'm not here to tell you I've got the most innovative technology. No - I've looked at the real, hardcore problems and said, 'What is it that I need to resolve?\" Plastic Energy, meanwhile, is successfully converting plastic waste into pyrolysis oil that can be used to make food and medical grade plastic. Headquartered in London, the company has plants in Spain, France and the Netherlands. CEO Ian Temperton is preparing to benefit from an anticipated under supply of recycled plastic as recycled content targets kick in across Europe: by 2040, plastic drinks bottles must contain at least 65% recycled content. \"We're about developing and continuing to enhance the technology that deals with waste plastics. Having partners commit to new investments over the next couple of years is going to be a bit harder, but it's very clear the market will be very significantly under-supplied against any version of the targets,\" says Mr Temperton. \"So I will keep my team focused on the best technology for when that comes.\""}

Only five England teams have won an Ashes series in this country since World War II and just two of those successes have come in the past 40 years. England have not taken a series here since 2010-11, which was also the last time they won a Test in Australia. But Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum have breathed life into England's Test cricket since they took charge in 2022. After a thrilling and controversial Ashes series in the UK was drawn 2-2 in 2023, the latest of edition of cricket's oldest rivalry is one of the most eagerly anticipated in recent memory. And Stokes' team will begin Friday's first Test in Perth with a genuine chance of pulling off a rare away Ashes triumph. \"A lot has been spoken of about the history and how it has gone for England,\" said Stokes. \"This is our chance to create our own history and it is up to us how that looks.\" England have not won an Ashes series since a 2015 triumph on home soil. They surrendered the urn with a 4-0 defeat in Australia in 2017-18 and have not won it back since. The key battles - where the Ashes will be won and lost England name Bashir in squad for Ashes opener England name their 12 for first Ashes Test 'The first hour in Perth will be really special' - Vaughan looks ahead to Ashes series Stokes has been part of an Ashes-winning team once since making his debut in 2013. He has created some all-time great Ashes moments, most notably his epic unbeaten 135 to win the Headingley Ashes Test of 2019. The all-rounder is assured of his place in English sporting history for his exploits in Test cricket and match-winning performances in each of the 2019 50-over World Cup and the 2022 T20 World Cup finals. If the 34-year-old were to join the other five post-war leaders to leave Australia with the urn, Stokes would be in the conversation as one of England's greatest cricketers. \"I know this is a series that probably gets highlighted above all the other series that I've been a captain in,\" he said. \"But it will not diminish anything of the time, energy and effort I've given to being an England captain.\" England could unleash their fastest attack in a Test by naming five pacemen in their XI for the series opener at Perth Stadium. Mark Wood, Jofra Archer, Gus Atkinson, Brydon Carse and Stokes can all touch 90mph. The battery of fast bowlers available to the tourists for this series is a result of long-term planning to arrive in Australia with the pace England feel is required to be successful here. \"If we went back two years before we picked the squad, and that's what we had available to us, we would have bitten your hand off,\" said Stokes. He added England are \"fortunate\" to have been able to select bowlers who can \"add skill\" to their pace too. Stokes is back to fitness after recovering from a shoulder injury that kept him out of England's last Test, against India in July. The Durham man has not completed any of England's past four series because of various injuries and his fitness will be crucial to hopes of regaining the urn. \"I've come into the series fully taking on that all-rounder role with bat and ball,\" he said. \"I've worked very, very hard to make sure when I am playing I'm able to give that full commitment to that role, just because I know how much of an impact it makes towards the team and how it balances the side out.\" Meet Australia's deadly accurate 'hired assassin' The whole country is against you when you play in Australia - Finn It’s been a dream to play in an Ashes series England have won once in 14 visits to Perth, against a weakened Australia team in 1978. All previous Ashes Tests in this city were at the fabled Waca, a notoriously hostile ground for visiting teams. Perth is hosting the first Test in an Ashes series for the first time. Rather than the Waca, the venue will be the new 60,000-seater Perth Stadium. Australia have been hit by injuries in the run-up to this series. Captain Pat Cummins is out for at least the first Test because of a back problem, while fellow pace bowler Josh Hazlewood misses out because of a hamstring issue. The hosts look set to give Test debuts to opening batter Jake Weatherald and pace bowler Brendan Doggett. But Stokes does not believe England's task is made any easier by the Australia selection upheaval. \"We really like to focus on ourselves, while keeping a little side eye to the opposition,\" he said. \"This game won't be taken more easily than it would normally if they were able to field what everyone would think would be their strongest XI.\" Unsuccessful Ashes tours often result in sweeping changes to England teams. Head coach Chris Silverwood lost his job after England were beaten here 4-0 four years ago and captain Joe Root resigned soon after. McCullum was already contracted through to 2027 and Stokes has signalled his intention play for England in the next home Ashes in the same year by signing a new two-year contract. Asked whether that was an \"easy decision\" when he could have chosen to spend the final years of his career on the lucrative franchise circuit, Stokes replied: \"Very easy. \"I want to eke everything out of this body I can and I will do that in an England shirt.\" Get cricket news sent straight to your phone"}

Series take place every two years, with each side taking it in turns to host the series during their respective summers. Each game can last a maximum of five days with four results - Australia win, England win, draw and tie - possible. The team that wins the most Tests takes the series and becomes the holder of the Ashes. If the series is drawn then Australia will retain the Ashes because they are the current holders. The first Test in Perth takes place at the Optus Stadium. It will be the first time the ground has hosted an Ashes Test, with all 13 Ashes Tests in Perth previously held at the Waca. It means Australia will start a home Ashes series away from the Gabba in Brisbane for the first time since 1982-83. The Gabba, where Australia have won 13 of their 22 Ashes Tests and are unbeaten against England in the format since 1986, will instead host the second Test from 4 to 8 December. That fixture will be a day-night match using a pink ball - the first time an Ashes Test has been held under floodlights at the ground. England will then head to the Adelaide Oval for the third Test from 17 to 21 December. That match will be followed by the traditional Boxing Day Test at the 100,024-capacity Melbourne Cricket Ground from 26 to 30 December (23:30 GMT on 25 December) The five-match series concludes at the Sydney Cricket Ground from 4 to 8 January (23:30 GMT, 3 January). England's squad is settled with captain Ben Stokes leading a similar group of players over the past couple of years. Stokes has had operations on his left knee and hamstring in the past two years and missed the fifth India Test in August with a shoulder injury. Batter Joe Root will return to Australia in search of a first century in the country, while Ben Duckett, Harry Brook and wicketkeeper Jamie Smith will play their first Ashes Tests down under. One of the key selection debates will be around who bats at three with incumbent Ollie Pope under pressure from Jacob Bethell. England have had a long-term plan to arrive in Australia with a battery of extremely quick pace bowlers and in Jofra Archer, Mark Wood, Josh Tongue, Gus Atkinson and Brydon Carse that has been accomplished. Shoaib Bashir will be the frontline spinner with Surrey all-rounder Will Jacks given a surprise call-up as the reserve. Australia's captain Pat Cummins will miss the first Test as he continues to build back to full fitness after a lower back injury. Batter Steve Smith, who has an excellent record against England, will lead the side in Perth. Cummins' place in the side is set to be taken by Scott Boland, who has been Australia's back-up seamer in recent years. He should join regulars Mitchell Star and and spinner Nathan Lyon in the XI. However, Australia suffered another blow a week out from the first Test whenJosh Hazlewood was ruled outwith a hamstring injury. It means uncapped Brendan Doggett may make his debut. Australia still need to work out their top order with uncapped Tasmania batter Jake Weatherald named in the squad as an opener option. He is not guaranteed to make his debut though, with Marnus Labuschagne an option. That may depend if Cameron Green is able to play as an all-rounder or as a specialist batter. Australia go into the series as favourites having held the Ashes since 2017. The last series to be won by the away side was England's victory in 2010-11. Only twice this century has the away team won the series outright (Australia in 2001 and England in 2010-11). England's past three visits to Australia have seen them suffer 5-0, 4-0 and 4-0 defeats. Former England bowlerStuart Broad has saidAustralia are \"massive favourites\" but added: \"It's probably the worst Australian team since 2010 when England last won, and it's the best English team since 2010.\" The first edition of the men's Ashes took place in 1882-1883 in Australia, with England winning a three-Test series 2-1. There have been 73 previous Ashes series with Australia winning 34 and England 32. The other seven have ended in draws with Australia retaining the Ashes in six of those series. There have been 345 Ashes Tests, with Australia winning 142, England 110 and 93 draws.

Earlier this year, the man filed a case claiming that in 2009 he was tricked by Wootton into sending him explicit photographs of himself as well as an explicit video. He says Wootton did this by sending him sexualised messages, pretending to be a woman called Maria Joseph. In documents filed at the High Court, Wootton denies ever communicating \"via any medium\" with the man, who has been granted anonymity by the court. Wootton also denies that he \"ever has been in possession\" of any \"explicit photographs or video\" portraying the man. The anonymous claimant has previously told the court that in 2009 Wootton communicated with him via email, SMS and Facebook. The man says that at the time he believed he was communicating with a woman called Maria Joseph, and did not know that he was, in fact, communicating with Wootton, according to the claim. The man says that the messages soon became \"sexualised and flirtatious\", and that Wootton sent him photographs of a female which, he claims, Wootton falsely pretended were of the woman the claimant thought he had been communicating with. He says that some of the photographs showed the female partially or fully naked. The man also said Wootton sent him a video of a man and a woman having sex, again pretending that the female in the video was the woman whom the anonymous claimant thought he was communicating with. In documents filed recently at the High Court, Wootton said it was denied that he \"communicated with the claimant via any medium - including email, SMS or Facebook; and denied that he sent the claimant any images or videos\". The anonymous man also previously said in his claim that believing that he was communicating with a woman, he responded to the messages in a flirtatious and sexualised manner. He said Wootton (pretending to be Maria Joseph) encouraged him to send explicit photographs of himself. The man added that \"in the induced belief that he was communicating with Maria Joseph, an unknown female who was interested in a sexual relationship\", and who had already sent explicit images of herself, he was \"persuaded to and did send\" explicit photographs of himself as well as an explicit video. Wootton says in court documents it is denied that he \"was or ever has been in possession of any flirtatious or sexualised messages from the claimant, or explicit photographs or video portraying the claimant\". He also said in the documents that the anonymous claimant did not believe that the recipient of his messages was called Maria Joseph. Wootton added that the claimant stated to Maria Joseph: \"Maria (if that is really your name)... we are in a catch 22. i can't play without finding this out. won't tell them as i'm not gonna advertise the fact i have apparently started to chatting to hot strangers on the internet. or tell me your real name then? [sic]\". The anonymous claimant is suing Wootton, saying that he has suffered pain, injury, humiliation and hurt to his feelings. And that he has sustained loss and damage because of Wootton's actions. He says that he has suffered from major depressive disorder and use of alcohol. Wootton has said that he does not accept that the anonymous claimant has suffered \"any injury as a result of any communication of messages, images, and/or videos between him and 'Maria Joseph'.\" He has denied that he and the man were former colleagues, and said the man's claim should not be allowed, because any case should have been brought years before."}

Her attacker was convicted in August 2025 - more than two years later - but only after the trial was cancelled twice at short notice. Sharing her story with BBC Newsnight, she said she kept going because she had a \"gut instinct that [her attacker] had done this before and he would do it again\", adding: \"We had to stop him\". It comes as new research by the charity Rape Crisis England and Wales found a third of all trials were postponed at least once in 2024 - up from one in 10 in 2015. Ms Loughman, 36, who has chosen to waive her right to anonymity, said hearing that her first court date had been pulled left her \"devastated\" but that she was determined to keep fighting a \"system that is constructed to dismiss you\". She said she also learned that after the first delay, her attacker was repeatedly breaching his bail conditions. \"He could have been anywhere,\" she said. The second delay came after Ms Loughman received a message from police saying the trial was \"all clear\" to go ahead, only for the case to be withdrawn again eight hours later with no explanation. Ms Loughman told Newsnight she became \"a shadow\" of herself, suffering nightmares, flashbacks and acute post-traumatic stress disorder that caused severe vomiting episodes. \"I basically lost my job. I lost my home. My home was a crime scene. I was terrified to be awake, terrified to be asleep because of the nightmares and the flashbacks,\" she said. Rape Crisis England and Wales said the widespread delays in the justice system it found as part of its research were a \"direct cause of retraumatisation\" for victims and left more women and girls at risk of violence and abuse. Justice Minister Sarah Sackman told Newsnight that the situation was \"absolutely unacceptable\" and acknowledged that the criminal courts were \"in a state of crisis\", but added that the government was working to expand courtroom capacity and recruit more staff across the system. \"Justice delayed is justice denied,\" she said. Ministry of Justice data shows that the Crown Court backlog has hit record highs, with more than 78,000 open cases as of June 2025. With her attacker finally convicted, Ms Loughman said she was only now beginning to rebuild her life. \"It's only now that he has been convicted that I can start to feel like myself again,\" she said. \"Being raped violates you in the most horrifying of ways. I couldn't look people in the eye for two-and-a-half years and it is only now then I can start to rebuild my life.\" If you have been affected by sexual abuse or violence, help and support is available atBBC Action Line."}

Some of the documents mention Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, the former prince and brother of King Charles; US President Donald Trump; Trump's former advisor Steve Bannon; and a cast of other characters from the world of media, politics and entertainment, who highlight the extent of Epstein's contact book. Trump was a friend of Epstein's for years, but the president has said they fell out in about 2004, years before Epstein was first arrested. Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein. Here are some of the the other names that came up, which does not indicate wrongdoing by any of the parties mentioned. Michael Wolff, 72, is an American journalist and columnist - as well as a prolific author of books on the wealthy and the famous. Fire and Fury, the first of several books spanning Trump's first stint as US president, came out in 2018, with descriptions of a dysfunctional White House and salacious details about the US commander-in-chief. Trump said it was \"full of lies\". The new batch of files related to Jeffrey Epstein shed light on a relationship that appears to indicate a correspondence between Wolff and the late convicted sex offender. Attention has focused particularly on one of the emails, in which Wolff appears to give Epstein advice in relation to Trump, as Trump was campaigning for the White House for the first time. Wolff wrote to Epstein in 2015 to notify him that CNN was planning to ask Trump, as a presidential candidate, about his relationship with Epstein. Epstein replied: \"If we were able to craft an answer for him, what do you think it should be?\" The two go on to discuss a strategy, with Wolff writing: \"I think you should let him hang himself.\" In a separate email from October 2016, days before the US presidential election, Wolff offers Epstein a chance to sit for an interview that could \"finish\" Trump. Responding to the release in a video posted to Instagram, Wolff said: \"Some of those emails are between Epstein and me, with Epstein discussing his relationship with Donald Trump.\" \"I have been trying to talk about this story for a very long time now,\" he added. In fact, Wolff disclosed before the latest presidential election in the US that he had interviewed Epstein \"periodically\" for Fire and Fury - and released tapes of those conversations. The documents include correspondence between Epstein and Larry Summers, who was Democratic President Bill Clinton's Treasury Secretary, and a former Harvard University president. It had been previously reported that the two men knew each other. The emails indicate the two met for dinner frequently, with Epstein often trying to connect Summers to prominent global figures. At one point, in July 2018, Epstein proposed a meeting with the \"presidnt [sic] of united nations, interesting person for you\". In a separate email from late November 2016, just after Trump's election, Summers asked Epstein to \"spend zero effort on anything about me with Trump\". Due to Trump's \"approach to conflict of interest\", \"[Russian President Vladimir] Putin proximity\" and a \"mindless response\" to Cuban leader Fidel Castro's death, Summers said he was \"best off a million miles away\". After the emails were released, Summers said he would step back from public commitments, but continue his teaching work. He quit the board of artificial intelligence firm OpenAI. \"I am deeply ashamed of my actions and recognise the pain they have caused,\" he said in a statement to CBS News, the BBC's US partner. \"I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr Epstein.\" The Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank in Washington where Summers was a senior fellow, announced he was no longer affiliated with the organisation. The House of Representatives Oversight Committee released several email exchanges between Epstein and Kathryn Ruemmler, a lawyer who served as White House counsel during the presidency of Barack Obama. In August 2018, Ms Ruemmler and Epstein discussed hush-money payments made by Trump to adult film star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election - an issue over which Trump was later convicted of falsifying business records. Trump denies allegations that he had an affair with Daniels. The exchange between Ms Ruemmler and Epstein culminated with Epstein writing: \"You see, I know how dirty donald is.\" The bank Goldman Sachs, where Ms Ruemmler is currently chief legal officer and general counsel, told CNBC it was standing by its employee. \"These emails were private correspondence well before Kathy Ruemmler joined Goldman Sachs. Kathy is an exceptional general counsel and we benefit from her judgment every day,\" Goldman spokesperson Tony Fratto said in a statement toCNBC. In 2023, Ms Ruemmlertold the Wall Street Journal,\"I regret ever knowing Jeffrey Epstein.\" The BBC has asked Ms Ruemmler and Goldman Sachs for further comment. The name of billionaire investor and on-off Trump supporter Peter Thiel appeared again in the latest Epstein documents - having first been mentioned in a batch made public in September. According to the newly-released files, Epstein wrote to Mr Thiel in November 2018 to invite him to visit him in his Caribbean island, where some of Epstein's crimes are thought to have been committed. The BBC has asked the Thiel Foundation and the investor's Founders Fund for comment. A representative for Mr Thiel told Politico that he had never visited the island. Mr Thiel was critical of Epstein on an August 2024 episode of The Joe Rogan Experience podcast. \"You know, I met Epstein a few times as well,\" Thiel said. Mr Thiel said he was introduced to Epstein by another Silicon Valley executive in 2014. \"I didn't check, didn't ask any - enough questions about it,\" Mr Thiel said. He surmised that \"Epstein knew a lot about taxes\". The latest document drop includes more correspondence between the famed linguist Noam Chomsky, 96, and Epstein. Many of their discussions were academic or personal. Occasionally the conversations turned to the subject of Trump, including in December 2016. In his email, Mr Chomsky tells Epstein: \"I notice your prediction was right about Trump avoiding the White House as far too primitive.\" The BBC has contacted a representative of Mr Chomsky for comment. In responses to previous reporting by the Wall Street Journal on their relationship, Mr Chomsky said Epstein had helped him move money between his accounts without \"one penny from Epstein\", and to acknowledge that \"I knew him and we met occasionally\". Epstein consulted publicist Peggy Siegal as the scandal around him and his associates unfolded. Epstein wrote to Ms Siegal in 2011 asking her to contact the founder of the Huffington Post, Ariana Huffington, in order to discredit the story of Virginia Giuffre, who was a prominent accuser of Epstein and Andrew. Giuffre died by suicide earlier this year. Epstein told Siegal that Huffington \"should champion the dangers of false allegations...\". The email exchange shows Ms Siegal telling Epstein: \"If you rewrite your last email in better grammar, (and so I have a better understanding) I can cut and paste and send it to Ariana Huffington from me…\". In a phone interview, Ms Siegal told the BBC she had never passed Epstein's request to Huffington. \"I did not call Ariana,\" she said. Huffington \"used to publish my writing and there's no reason in the world I would jeopardise that relationship,\" Ms Siegal added. But the fact that Epstein had asked was \"not unusual. It was a ridiculous request,\" she said. \"Jeffrey had a habit of trying to ensnare people into his delusional world,\" she added. Meanwhile, Huffington told Politico she was \"was never contacted and never sent a reporter\"."}

Peter Sullivan told the BBC he believes he was \"stitched up\" in 1986 over the killing of Diane Sindall, who was ambushed and beaten to death during a frenzied sexual attack in Birkenhead, Wirral. Mr Sullivan, who has learning difficulties, had his conviction quashed by the Court of Appeal in May after new DNA tests were carried out. He now wants an apology from Merseyside Police. The force said while it \"regretted\" that a \"grave miscarriage of justice\" had taken place, it maintained its officers acted within the law at the time. Earlier the force said ithad referred itself to watchdogthe Independent Office for Police Conduct for a second time based on Mr Sullivan's comments - having initially done so in May after the appeal decision. Speaking from an undisclosed location with his face hidden to protect his privacy, Mr Sullivan, 68, said he wanted an explanation for why detectives \"picked me out\". \"I can't forgive them for what they've done to me, because it's going to be there for the rest of my life,\" he said, adding he had \"lost everything\" since going to prison. \"I've got to carry that burden until I can get an apology.\" For decades Mr Sullivan and his family were haunted by tabloid press nicknames, including \"The Beast of Birkenhead\", \"The Mersey Ripper\", and \"The Wolfman\". \"The names, they'll always stick with me because I've never been anything like that,\" he said. Mr Sullivan said despite moments of near hopelessness, he was always supported by his parents who died years before he could clear his name. He said: \"My mum turned around to me before she died, and said, 'I want you to carry on fighting this case because you've done nothing wrong'.\" In one of many painful moments from his time behind bars, Mr Sullivan said he was denied permission to attend his mother's funeral in 2013 because she was buried in the same cemetery as Miss Sindall. His ordeal began after the semi-naked body of 21-year-old florist Miss Sindall was found with catastrophic injuries in an alley off Borough Road, Birkenhead, on 2 August 1986. Two weeks later, her partially burned clothing was found on Bidston Hill, a large area of woodland about an hour's walk from the alley. After a BBC Crimewatch appeal was aired, witnesses came forward claiming to have seen Mr Sullivan in a pub near the murder scene that night, while others reported seeing a man fitting his description near Bidston Hill the following day. He was arrested on suspicion of murder on 23 September 1986, and was interviewed 22 times over the following four weeks. For the first seven police interviews, he was denied legal advice and found the experience \"very daunting\". \"They were putting stuff into my mind, then they would send me back to my cell, then I'd come back and say what they wanted, not realising what I was doing at the time,\" he said. During that period Mr Sullivan claimed he was beaten in his cell on two occasions by police officers. \"They threw a blanket over the top of me and they were hitting me on top of the blanket with the truncheons to try and get me to co-operate with them,\" he said. \"It really hurt, they were leathering me.\" Mr Sullivan also claimed he was told if he did not confess he would be charged with \"35 other rapes\", and said he was denied food and sleep. He was not provided with an appropriate adult to help him understand the interrogation, despite police custody records noting he had learning difficulties. Asked why he would confess to a murder he did not commit, Mr Sullivan said: \"All I can say, it was the bullying that forced me to throw my hands in, because I couldn't take it anymore.\" Appeal court documents confirm that the first time he \"confessed\" was not recorded and no solicitor was present. Other police interviews were recorded. In a statement for this article, Merseyside Police said it was previously unaware of the allegations about beatings or threats to charge him with other offences, and said records from the time did not contain details of this. It said guidance on appropriate adults had been strengthened since 1986. The force accepted that legal advice was initially refused for interviews, adding that officers had feared revealing some parts of the investigation to a solicitor, in case evidence was destroyed. It also said Mr Sullivan was told he did not have to speak to officers unless he wished to do so. Sarah Myatt, Mr Sullivan's solicitor of more than 20 years, sat alongside him as he spoke to the BBC. \"I think, from what he's told me, he just reached breaking point with it,\" she said. Mr Sullivan said during one interview he was asked to mark on a map where he had left the clothes on Bidston Hill. When he pointed to the wrong place, he alleges a detective replied: \"Come on Peter, you know better than that,\" before hinting at the \"correct\" location. Ms Myatt said on the maps of Bidston Hill, Mr Sullivan had later written \"this is all lies\". \"I think that's quite poignant,\" she said. Merseyside Police said the maps and transcripts, which the BBC has not seen, were all served on the courts. The force said interviewing officers had been \"trying to understand the validity of his admissions\". While Mr Sullivan later retracted his confessions, the police and prosecution also relied on bite mark evidence, a now widely discredited field of forensic science. That case, brought before DNA testing was widely available, was enough to convince a jury at Liverpool Crown Court - and on 5 November 1987 he went from a self-confessed \"petty thief\" to a convicted murderer. Recalling the guilty verdicts, Mr Sullivan said: \"My sister collapsed in the courtroom and the next minute, that was it. \"I was taken down from the courtroom and I just sat in that cell and cried my eyes out over the crime I hadn't done. \"I knew from then on that this is going to be one hell of a case to try and fight to try and get myself out of this situation.\" His sentence carried a minimum term of 16 years before he was eligible to apply for parole - but Mr Sullivan maintained his innocence, lessening his chances of release. Prison was particularly difficult for someone considered a savage killer and a sex offender. \"I've been battered in prisons because of the crime I was in for,\" he said. However, he said reporting such violence was not an option because \"then you're a grass, and that means then you're going to get a lot worse\". The end of his nightmare began in 2023, when the Criminal Cases Review Commission - the body set up to check for miscarriages of justice - ordered fresh testing of semen samples found on Miss Sindall's body in 1986. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided not to challenge the DNA results ahead of a fresh appeal - paving the way for Mr Sullivan's freedom. In May 2025, when the appeal judgement was handed down, Mr Sullivan was listening via video-link from HMP Wakefield, sitting next to his probation officer. \"When they came back in with the verdict that my case had been quashed, [the probation officer] burst into tears first,\" he said. \"She turned around and said, 'Peter, you're going home'... \"Next minute, bang, all the tears started running down my face and that was it, I went, 'yes, justice has been done'.\" The outside world has been a baffling place for a man who went into custody when Margaret Thatcher was prime minister and the internet was unheard of. Speaking of the moment he was driven out of prison, he said: \"I was watching the cars go by, and I've never seen so many different cars in my life on that road. \"It was daunting just seeing them all changed and everything.\" Since his release, he has sometimes found himself standing in his bedroom waiting for a prison officer to do a roll-call - a difficult habit to shake after nearly 40 years. Mr Sullivan said he feels \"really sorry\" for the family of Miss Sindall, who he said are \"back at square one\" in their fight for justice. \"I've been through the same pain, being in prison, because I've been taken away from my family as well for something I haven't done,\" he said. Merseyside Police said due to the \"substantial changes\" in the law and investigative practices since 1986, there would be \"little benefit\" in any formal review of how the case was investigated. It said \"no misconduct was identified\" at the time of the first IOPC referral in May, but confirmed it would ask the body to look again after Mr Sullivan's interview. The Crown Prosecution Service said while the Court of Appeal accepted the new DNA testing, other grounds of appeal were rejected. Nick Price, its director of legal services, said: \"The prosecution case was brought on the basis of all the evidence available to us at the time.\" The case of Miss Sindall's murder has been re-opened, although no arrests have been made. For Mr Sullivan, there remains the wait for compensation, capped by the government at £1.3m for wrongful convictions. Ms Myatt, who is helping him with his application, said: \"There's not a figure that you could say would be enough for losing 38 years of your life.\" Listen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside onBBC Soundsand follow BBC Merseyside onFacebook,X, andInstagram, and watch BBC North West Tonight onBBC iPlayer."}

In an exclusive interview, chief executive Sundar Pichai said that AI models are \"prone to errors\" and urged people to use them alongside other tools. Mr Pichai said it highlighted the importance of having a rich information ecosystem, rather than solely relying on AI technology. \"This is why people also use Google search, and we have other products that are more grounded in providing accurate information.\" However, some experts say big tech firms such as Google should not be inviting users to fact-check their tools' output, but should focus instead on making their systems more reliable. While AI tools were helpful \"if you want to creatively write something\", Mr Pichai said people \"have to learn to use these tools for what they're good at, and not blindly trust everything they say\". He told the BBC: \"We take pride in the amount of work we put in to give us as accurate information as possible, but the current state-of-the-art AI technology is prone to some errors.\" The company displays disclaimers on its AI tools to let users know they can make mistakes. But this has not shielded it from criticism and concerns over errors made by its own products. Google's rollout of AI Overviews summarising its search results was marred by criticism and mockeryover some erratic, inaccurate responses. The tendency for generative AI products, such as chatbots, to relay misleading or false information, is a cause of concern among experts. \"We know these systems make up answers, and they make up answers to please us - and that's a problem,\" Gina Neff, professor of responsible AI at Queen Mary University of London, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \"It's okay if I'm asking 'what movie should I see next', it's quite different if I'm asking really sensitive questions about my health, mental wellbeing, about science, about news,\" she said. She also urged Google to take more responsibility over its AI products and their accuracy, rather than passing that on to consumers. \"The company now is asking to mark their own exam paper while they're burning down the school,\" the said. The tech world has been awaiting the latest launch of Google's consumer AI model, Gemini 3.0, which is starting to win back market share from ChatGPT. The company unveiled the model on Tuesday, claiming it would unleash \"a new era of intelligence\" at the heart of its own products such as its search engine. In a blog post,it saidGemini 3 boasted industry-leading performance across understanding and responding to different modes of input, such as photo, audio and video, as well as \"state-of-the-art\" reasoning capabilities. In May this year, Google began introducing a new \"AI Mode\" into its search, integrating its Gemini chatbot which isaimed at giving users the experience of talking to an expert. At the time, Mr Pichai said the integration of Gemini with search signalled a \"new phase of the AI platform shift\". The move is also part of the tech giant's bid to remain competitive against AI services such as ChatGPT, which have threatened Google's online search dominance. His comments back up BBC research from earlier this year, which found that AI chatbots inaccurately summarised news stories. OpenAI's ChatGPT, Microsoft's Copilot, Google's Gemini and Perplexity AI were all given content from the BBC website and asked questions about it, and the research found the AI answerscontained \"significant inaccuracies\". Broader BBC findings have since suggested that, despite improvements, AI assistantsstill misrepresent news 45% of the time. In his interview with the BBC, Mr Pichai said there was some tension between how fast technology was being developed and how mitigations are built in to prevent potential harmful effects. For Alphabet, Mr Pichai said managing that tension means being \"bold and responsible at the same time\". \"So we are moving fast through this moment. I think our consumers are demanding it,\" he said. The tech giant has also increased its investment in AI security in proportion with its investment in AI, Mr Pichai added. \"For example, we are open-sourcing technology which will allow you to detect whether an image is generated by AI,\" he said. Asked about recently uncovered years-old comments from tech billionaire Elon Musk to OpenAI's founders around fears the now Google-owned DeepMind could create an AI \"dictatorship\", Mr Pichai said \"no one company should own a technology as powerful as AI\". But he added there were many companies in the AI ecosystem today. \"If there was only one company which was building AI technology and everyone else had to use it, I would be concerned about that too, but we are so far from that scenario right now,\" he said."}

The project - a collaboration between the Fleming Initiative and the pharmaceutical company GSK - is a battle between superbugs and supercomputers. It aims to speed up the discovery of fresh antibiotics and deliver new ways of killing other threats, including deadly fungal infections. Overusing antibiotics drives bacteria to evolve resistance to infections, which means new drugs are a priority. Drug-resistant infections are a growing problem – one known as \"the silent pandemic\". Superbugs are now thought to directly kill aroundone million people a yearworldwide and contribute to the deaths of millions more. Those figures are predicted to continue to grow. The collaboration will spend £45m on six fields of research. \"This represents the single biggest investment in a UK antibiotic project I'm aware of,\" says Dr Andrew Edwards from Imperial College London. He will be targeting AI at a tricky group of infections, called Gram-negative bacteria, that includes well known bugs such asE. coliandKlebsiella pneumoniae. These species have an extra outer layer they use to control what gets in and out of a bacterium. Gram-negative species can block antibiotics from getting in and rapidly pump out those that penetrate the bacterial defences – making them tough to treat. The team will be performing experiments using molecules with different chemical structures and recording what can get inside and stay inside these bacteria. This data will then be fed into the AI so it can learn what it takes for an antibiotic to persist inside a Gram-negative bacterium. \"The sort of AI that people are using routinely today is built on the sum total of information on the internet - it doesn't just produce answers out of thin air,\" Dr Edwards told the BBC. \"If you want to make progress, you have to have data,\" he says. The aim is to convert years of research, if done by hand, into a simple job for a computer. Then once the chemical code has been cracked, it will guide scientists on how to modify potential antibiotics to bypass the organism's defences. Dr Edwards said there were cases coming out of the conflict in Ukraine now where infections could not be treated with any antibiotic. \"That means that limbs have to be amputated. I would say it's a glimpse into the future, but it's happening right now, it's a pretty horrific thought.\" So can AI outpace bacterial evolution? \"That's a very good question, I think what we've seen is that if we can get a few good antibiotics, then we'll be back on on the front foot and then I think we can keep things in check,\" says Dr Edwards. The Fleming Initiative is named after Alexander Fleming, who discovered penicillin in 1928 and started the antibiotic age. Even by the time he won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 80 years ago,he had warned of the dangers of resistance. Alison Holmes, the director of the Fleming Initiative, said antibiotics were \"one of the greatest health resources that has been squandered\" and we should all think of how much we owe to antibiotics. \"Whether it's that time we stepped on a nail and or got cellulitis following an insect bite or our C-section wound, or our UTI, or our STI - we all depend on them,\" she said. The collaboration will also use AI like a weather forecast to predict how superbugs emerge and spread. And the project is also looking beyond bacteria to use AI to tackle the rise of deadly fungal infections, starting with Aspergillus mould. Its spores are normally harmless, but can become deadly in people with weakened immune systems. Tony Wood, the chief scientific officer at GSK, said: \"We will open up new approaches for the discovery of novel antibiotics as well as anticipate and outpace the development of resistance to transform the treatment and prevention of serious infections.\" Researchers in the US and Canada have already started using AI to shortlist drugs or even design antibiotics from scratch to target drug-resistant bacteria like gonorrhoea. Data for the UKsuggests nearly 400 new antibiotic-resistant infections are being detected every week."}

Residents in Khartoum, which is controlled by the army, told the AFP news agency that they were woken overnight by the sound of drones and explosions. The blasts appeared to take place near a military base and a power station in the early hours of Friday morning, the residents said. The RSF has not addressed these accounts, but Sudan's military-led government said it would be wary of agreeing to a truce as the group did not \"respect\" ceasefires. The two sides have been embroiled in a civil war that has killed at least 150,000 people and forced 12 million others from their homes since it erupted in April 2023. This week a UN-backed global hunger monitor confirmed that famine conditions were spreading in conflict zones. On Friday, drones were heard not only in Khartoum, but also 300km (186 miles) north of the city, in the military-controlled town of Atbara. \"Anti-aircraft defences shot them down, but I saw fires breaking out and heard sounds of explosions in the east of the city,\" a resident there told AFP. The day before,the RSF announced it had agreed to a humanitarian truceproposed by the US, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia and Egypt. The four countries put forward the plan in September - and said it should be followed by a permanent ceasefire and a transition to civilian rule. At the time the Sudanese government rejected \"foreign interference\" and any attempts that equated it with a \"racist terrorist militia that relies on foreign mercenaries\". It is not clear if the proposal has been modified since then. But during a press conference on Friday, Sudan's ambassador to South Africa said it was too early for his country to agree to the plan. \"From our experience, we had many truces at the beginning of the war but every time there was no respect from [the RSF],\" Osman Abufatima Adam Mohammed said. \"They use these truces to move to new areas and make moves against the government.\" The ambassador opposed the UAE's presence at the ceasefire talks, repeating his government's allegation that the Gulf nation was supplying the RSF with weapons and foreign fighters. UN experts say accusations of such military support are credible, but the UAE has denied all involvement with the RSF. The RSF and the military have agreed to ceasefire proposals before, but none have stuck. This time, the RSF waited until it had finally seized el-Fasher, a key city that it had been blockading for 18 months, before announcing it was on board with the truce. Now that the paramilitary group has consolidated control over el-Fasher and, consequently, the vast wider western region of Darfur, it may have greater leverage in future ceasefire negotiations. But the RSF is also facing an international backlash againstwidespread reports of mass killings and sexual violenceduring the fall of el-Fasher, which it has denied.

The pair, who had filmed a confrontation with the politician relating to the war in Gaza, challenged their convictions at Cardiff Crown Court this week and argued their actions fell within their right to free speech. Judge Tracey Lloyd-Clarke ruled the prosecutions were unnecessary and allowed both appeals, noting \"less intrusive\" measures of dealing with the case had not been pursued. She told the court on Wednesday that her decision did not imply there was any truth to allegations made about Ms Davies-Jones, who serves as parliamentary under-secretary of state for victims in the UK government. While out campaigning in the lead-up to the general election in June 2024, Ms Davies-Jones said she saw Ms Behit and Ms Ahmed with leaflets suggesting she was a \"full-blown supporter of this genocide\" - referring to the war in Gaza. TheLabour MPsaid she initially approached the defendants to try to defuse the situation, when the pair quizzed her on her voting record and asked why she had abstained on a ceasefire vote in the House of Commons. Ms Davies-Jones said she had not abstained but had been out of the country at the time. She said she decided to end the conversation as it became \"more aggressive\" and \"confrontational\", but that while walking away the pair followed and shouted at her. A video of the interaction played in court heard shouts of \"Alex Davies-Jones you support genocide\" and \"what do you think about children being tortured and murdered?\". She described feeling \"scared, intimidated and threatened\", and she and her team hid in a university building to get away from them. She also said she decided to stop her campaigning, aware of what had happened to to other MPs, including Jo Cox, who was murdered in 2016. An edited video of the Welsh MP's interaction with the pair was later posted on social media, with suggestions that she was racist and Islamophobic. She said she still received abuse on social media as a result of the video. During the three-day appeal, Francesca Cociani, for the appellants, said: \"Alex Davies-Jones as an individual and as a political figure come as a whole. \"[But] she was never targeted in her capacity as an individual, it wasn't at her home address that she was targeted. \"This was political speech... it was very clearly to do with Labour Party policy and decisions. \"It was not only in a public place but it was within her constituency... In the middle of a national campaign for the general election.\" The court heard it was not uncommon for Labour MPs to be accused of supporting genocide and the conflict in Gaza was a matter of significant public debate in the run-up to the election. The court heard Ms Behit and Ms Ahmed also put posters on the Labour office in Pontypridd - the base of the MP's campaign - that referred to politicians \"enabling genocide\" and stickers which read \"Alex Davies-Jones how many murdered children is too many?\" Following trial, Ms Ahmed, who had no previous convictions, was handed a 12-month conditional discharge and Ms Behit, who had a previous conviction relating to a protest in Cardiff last year, received an 18-month conditional discharge. Judge Lloyd-Clarke said Ms Behit and Ms Ahmed had carried out a \"planned and well-orchestrated campaign\" intended to harm the electoral prospects of Ms Davies-Jones. However, she noted that \"less intrusive\" measures such as a police warning or civil action were not pursued prior to prosecution. \"Nothing in this judgment implies, or should be taken to imply, that there is any truth in the accusations made by the appellants about Ms Davies-Jones. \"We are not satisfied that a prosecution was necessary... the appeals of both defendants are allowed.\" Ms Cociani described the decision as \"a great day for justice and common sense\". \"It was clear that my clients were exercising their freedom of speech during an election, as they were entitled to do, in our free and democratic country,\" she added. \"Their arrest, prosecution and conviction for harassment were an egregious affront on those rights and they are delighted to have finally been exonerated.\""}

The Irishman, who is ranked sixth, faces second-ranked American Muhammad in a bout which could determine the number one contender to face welterweight champion Islam Makhachev. Makhachev dominated Jack Della Maddalenato win the belt at UFC 322 last week on a card where a number of fellow welterweights put themselves in the spotlight. Brazil's Carlos Prates knocked out Britain's former champion Leon Edwards, while Ecuador's Michael Morales stopped American Sean Brady in equally impressive fashion. \"I want to make one thing clear. Everyone in this room, every interview I've done this week, they're all asking about people from last week,\" said Machado Garry. \"This week, when I knock out Belal Muhammad, I make every other person in the welterweight division irrelevant. I am going to cement myself as the number one contender. \"Islam Makhachev, get ready, I'll see you soon. Wherever and whenever you want, we're next.\" Makhachev goes top of UFC pound-for-pound rankings A win for the 28-year-old Machado Garry over former champion Muhammad, 37, will undoubtedly thrust his name into the conversation surrounding Makhachev's next challenger, but he may have to do something special to get the nod. Prates' straight left which downed Edwards provided the social media highlight of the card in a victory which saw him move up to fifth in the welterweight rankings. Morales, meanwhile, outclassed Brady on the feet before dealing the fight-ending combination which saw him extend his unbeaten record to 19 and move up to third in the rankings. Shavkat Rakhmonov, meanwhile, who is ranked four and beat Machado Garry last December, has finished six of his seven UFC opponents, but the Kazakhstan fighter is currently out injured. Fighters who finish opponents are often prioritised for title bouts because they are deemed more exciting to watch and that generates more viewers and more money for the UFC. Prates (100%), Rakhmonov (86%) and Morales (71%) all have higher finish rates than Machado Garry (33%) in the UFC, but he is confident of convincing matchmakers he deserves to be next. \"It's about me being the best and most interesting,\" added Machado Garry. \"The guys did a great job last week, however, I am the deciding factor in what happens to the rest of the division. \"My entire goal this weekend is to go out there and leave it undoubted, and unquestionable and undeniable that Ian Machado Gary is the best welterweight walking the planet right now.\" After his win over Della Maddalena, Makhachev, 34, has called for a title fight with former champion Kamaru Usman. The 38-year-old Nigerian, who beat Joaquin Edwards in June, is eighth in the welterweight rankings, one place above Edwards. Machado Garry argues the division has moved on, and Makhachev should be targeting younger fighters like himself, Prates and Morales rather than \"has-beens\". \"If I were Islam I'd want to fight Usman too, because it's an easy fight, an easy pay cheque and a first title defence,\" he added. \"That, for me, is a cop-out. Fight one of the up and comers, guys that are hungry, that have not felt like what it's like to be a champion, that are driven to achieve their dreams.\" Two team-mates of British lightweight Paddy Pimblett are set to make their UFC debuts on the undercard. Liverpool's Luke Riley, who has won the first 11 fights of his career, takes on Austria's Bogdan Grad at featherweight. Fellow Liverpudlian Shem Rock, meanwhile, faces Tajikistan's Nurullo Aliev at lightweight. Pimblett, who is fifth in the UFC's lightweight rankings, has travelled with the pair and is set to corner them for their bouts in Doha. It is likely he will cross paths with lightweight champion Ilia Topuria, whose brother Aleksandre also fights on the undercard.

Fighters laugh as they ride on the back of a pick-up truck, speeding past a row of nine dead bodies and driving towards the setting Sudanese sun. \"Look at all this work. Look at this genocide,\" one cheers. He smiles as he turns the camera on himself and his fellow fighters, their Rapid Support Forces (RSF) badges on display: \"They will all die like this.\" The men are celebrating a massacre that humanitarian officials fear killed more than 2,000 people in the Sudanese city of el-Fasher last month. On Monday, the International Criminal Court (ICC) said it was investigating whether the paramilitary may have committed \"war crimes and crimes against humanity\". El-Fasher was a key target for the paramilitary RSF. It was the last stronghold in Darfur held by the Sudanese military - with whom the RSF has waged a devastating war sincetheir ruling coalition collapsed in 2023. More than 150,000 people are estimated to have been killed by the fighting over the past two years and both sides stand accused of a litany of war crimes - many of which were repeated by the RSF after the fall of el-Fasher. Having held the city under siege for almost two years, from August the RSF moved to consolidate its position and blockade the remaining civilian population. Satellite images show that troops started to construct a massive berm - a raised sand barrier - around the perimeter of el-Fasher, sealing off access routes and blocking aid. By early October the ring completely surrounded the city - with a smaller barricade encircling a neighbouring village. As the siege intensified, 78 people were killed in anRSF attack on a mosque on 19 September, while the UN said 53 more were killed in drone and artillery strikes on a displacement camp in October. Videos shared with BBC Verify also suggested that the RSF sought to impose a blockade of food and essential supplies. In October, footage shows a man with his hands and feet tied behind his back, hanging upside down from a tree with metal chains. The man filming the video accused him of trying to smuggle supplies into the besieged city. \"I swear to God you will pay for this you dog,\" he shouted, before demanding that the captive beg for his life. Meanwhile, the RSF pushed forward into the city with troops engaged in frenetic street-to-street clashes. By sunrise on 26 October the RSF overwhelmed the final army positions and seized the main base in the city, the headquarters of the 6th Infantry Division, as the military withdrew. Soldiers were filmed laughing as they toured the abandoned headquarters carrying a grenade launcher. Later that day RSF commander Abdul Rahim Dagalo - brother of RSF chief Mohammad 'Hemedti' Dagalo - was seen inspecting the base. The RSF - whichemerged from the Janjaweed militiathat killed hundreds of thousands of people in Darfur between 2003-2005 - has long been accused of committing atrocities against non-Arab groups across Sudan. Footage posted online suggested that paramilitary fighters intended to unleash violence against the civilian population in el-Fasher. Prior to the paramilitary's seizure of el-Fasher,very little information had emergedfrom the city for months. But within hours of the military's collapse, footage of atrocities committed by the RSF started to appear online, shattering the silence that had fallen on the city. One of the most graphic videos to emerge and analysed by BBC Verify showed the aftermath of a massacre at a university building on the western side of the city, where dozens of dead bodies were seen scattered across the floor. An elderly man wearing a white tunic sat alone amongst the bodies. He turned to look as a fighter armed with a rifle walked down the stairs towards him. Raising his weapon, the gunman fired a single shot at the man, who collapsed to the floor motionless. Fellow soldiers, unfazed by the act, immediately spotted another man's leg twitch in the tangle of bodies. \"Why is this one still alive,\" one fighter cried. \"Shoot him.\" Satellite images taken on 26 October appeared to confirm that executions were also carried out on the streets of el-Fasher, according to a report published by the Yale Humanitarian Research Lab. Its analysts highlighted large \"clusters\" visible in the images, which they said were \"consistent with the size range of adult human bodies and are not present in previous imagery\". It also pointed to \"discoloration\" which the report said may have been marks caused by human blood. One eyewitness who spoke to the BBC said he had witnessed \"many of our relatives being massacred - they were gathered in one place and all killed\". Another witness recalled seeing a woman being killed after the RSF \"shot her in the chest\" before throwing her body aside \"after taking all her belongings\". While the main RSF force rampaged through el-Fasher, a separate group of fighters remained on the periphery of the city, where they engaged in the brutal executions of a number of unarmed captives. Most of this violence occurred at a site around 8km (5 miles) away from el-Fasher. Verified videos show dozens of dead bodies in civilian clothing - some of whom appear to be women - lying in a trench running along the periphery of the sand berm constructed by the RSF. Other clips display scenes of destruction, with fires raging and the burnt-out shells of trucks littered across the landscape. Videos from the scene also show bodies scattered between the vehicles. A key figure in the violence was previously identified by BBC Verify as anRSF commander who goes by Abu Luluonline. He was shown executing unarmed captives in two videos, while an eyewitness told the BBC that he \"gave an order to his men to kill several innocent people, including children\". One clip showed an RSF soldier attempting to intercede as Abu Lulu prepared to execute an injured man, while the captive pleaded: \"I know you. I called out to you a few days ago.\" Abu Lulu dismissed the man's pleas with a wave of his arms, stating: \"I will never have mercy. Our job is only killing.\" After aiming his rifle almost casually, the fighter unleashed a storm of bullets that tore through the unarmed man. Another video showed him killing a group of nine unarmed captives. Footage that emerged days later revealed the bodies were left where they had fallen - still lined up execution-style and lying on the dusty Darfuri ground. Many of those involved in the killings wore RSF badges, including the group who later celebrated the massacre as a \"genocide\". In the days that followed the massacre, RSF leader Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo admitted that his troops had committed \"violations\" and said the incidents would be investigated. A senior UN official said last week that the RSF had given notice that they had arrested some suspects within their ranks. Among thosedetained was Abu Luluafter BBC Verify published a report documenting his killings. Carefully choreographed and edited footage posted on the RSF's official Telegram account show him being led into a cell at a prison on the outskirts of el-Fasher. Yale analysts also accused the RSF of \"conducting clean-up of their alleged mass atrocities\". A report issued on 4 November noted that satellite images show the removal \"of objects consistent with bodies from a location north of RSF's berm\" and identified graves near the children's hospital in el-Fasher. BBC Verify measured white shapes seen in the hospital courtyard on 30 October as between 1.6m and 2m in length. This is similar to the height of an adult human and consistent with a body in a burial shroud commonly seen in Sudan. Meanwhile, the RSF and affiliated social media accounts began seeking to reframe the narrative. Posts showing its fighters handing out aid to civilians were shared by some users, while the paramilitary's media office shared several clips purporting to show the humane treatment of army prisoners of war. Despite the social media campaign being deployed by the RSF, their actions in el-Fasher have sparked global outrage. BBC Verify approached the RSF, offering it an opportunity to reply to the allegations contained in this investigation. The group did not reply.

Rhys stars as property tycoon Nile Jarvis in new Netflix thriller series The Beast in Me, alongside actress Claire Danes who portrays reclusive author Aggie Wiggs. On The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Rhys described the series as \"old-fashioned Hitchcockian\" and a game of \"cat and mouse\". The Cardiff-born actor said the 1990s classic film The Silence of the Lambs had influenced how he played his character. \"If you are going to steal, steal from the best. I stole a lot from Anthony Hopkins,\" he said. Rhys, who now lives in New York, was also asked by Fallon if there were any Welsh traditions that he kept in his family. The 51-year-old laughed as he shared that they eat leeks and lamb - and that they have a leek-eating competition on 1 March. \"I insist the children have coal in their Christmas stockings, which is a luxury item in Wales,\" he joked. Part of an old Welsh tradition, Rhys said he had also carved a Celtic love spoon for his partner Keri Russell for her birthday. \"That is beautiful,\" Fallon said. \"If the Welsh are going to do romance, they have to be practical,\" Rhys told Fallon. Fallon asked Rhys if there were any Welsh traditions that related to livestock. Rhys said: \"Sadly, you have to wait till one of the animals dies. But on New Year's Eve, it is called in Welsh 'the Mari Lwyd' or 'the Grey Mare', where a horse's head is draped with a cloak.\" He added: \"The Welsh have a bold statement in that we sort of pretend that we invented rap. \"You would sing a verse, and then someone on the other side of the door would sing a verse back as to why they shouldn't let you in.\" Rhys returned to Wales for his national tour playing Richard Burton in a one-man show that began on 17 November in Mwldan, Cardigan, and concludes in Pontrhydyfen."}

Key sticking points remain unresolved, including Hamas's disarmament, the reconstruction and future governance of Gaza, and the deployment of an international security force to the territory. Without a timeline for the discussions, which are likely to require significant concessions from both Israel and Hamas, there are doubts that any progress can be achieved. Another challenge has emerged recently, involving scores of Hamas fighters believed to be in tunnels beneath the southern city of Rafah behind the so-called \"Yellow Line\", which marks the area under Israeli control. Last week, US special envoy Steve Witkoff said an amnesty could be offered for fighters who laid down their arms, and that this could be a \"model\" for what Washington hoped to apply in the rest of Gaza. Witkoff said 200 fighters were trapped, although this number has not been confirmed. According to media reports, Kushner and the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, discussed the issue during a meeting in Jerusalem on Monday. Hamas has previously said the fighters will not surrender and demanded that they are given safe passage, which has so far been rejected by Israel. An Israeli government spokeswoman said Netanyahu and Kushner had \"discussed phase one, which we are currently still in, to bring our remaining hostages, and the future of phase two of this plan, which includes the disarming of Hamas, demilitarising Gaza, and ensuring Hamas will have no role in the future of Gaza ever again\". The war in Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, when about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. Since then, more than 69,000 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures the UN considers reliable. The first phase of the ceasefire, which came into force last month, focused on halting the war, returning all hostages, and securing a surge in humanitarian aid into Gaza. Twenty living hostages and the remains of 24 deceased captives have been released, with four bodies remaining in Gaza. In return, Israel has freed 250 Palestinian prisoners from its jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza who were being held without charge or trial. It has also handed over the remains of 315 Palestinians from Gaza. Both Israel and Hamas have accused each other of violating the truce, with Israel saying Hamas has deliberately delayed the return of the remains of hostages and Hamas saying that Israel has killed at least 240 Palestinians and is restricting the entry of aid supplies. Hamas has previously rejected disarmament, saying it would only do so once a Palestinian state has been established. Israel refuses any involvement in the governance of Gaza by the Western-backed Palestinian Authority, which is the body that governs parts of the occupied West Bank. Countries are reluctant to commit troops to the multinational force without clear goals, concerned that their soldiers might end up confronting fighters from Hamas and other Palestinian factions. The Israeli military currently occupies 53% of Gaza's territory and is expected to withdraw further in the next stage of the plan. With no indication of imminent advances in the negotiations,a de-facto partition of Gaza between the area controlled by Israel and another ruled by Hamas was increasingly likely, sources told the Reuters news agency, with talks about reconstruction apparently likely to be limited to the Israel-controlled territory. Arab countries have already expressed concerns that the current separation could become a permanent partition of Gaza. The Trump plan does not include a pathway to Palestinian statehood - a concept which Israel rejects."}

It didn't look like a hospital to me,\" she told the BBC from her home in Manitoba. That hospital – once the home of a Scottish shipping magnate – would be her home for a month in April 1958, after a judge ordered the then-16-year-old to undergo treatment for \"disobedient\" behaviour. It was there that Ms Ponting became one of thousands of people experimented on as part of the CIA's top-secret research into mind control. Now, she is one of two named plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit for Canadian victims of the experiments. On Thursday, a judge denied the Royal Victoria Hospital's appeal, paving the way for the lawsuit to proceed. According to her medical files, which she obtained only recently, Ms Ponting had been running away from home and hanging out with friends her parents disapproved of after a difficult move with her family from Ottawa to Montreal. \"I was an ordinary teenager,\" she recalled. But the judge sent her to the Allan. Once there, she became an unwitting participant in covert CIA experiments known as MK-Ultra. The Cold War project tested the effects of psychedelic drugs like LSD, electroshock treatments and brainwashing techniques on human beings without their consent. Over 100 institutions – hospitals, prisons and schools – in the US and Canada were involved. At the Allan, McGill University researcher Dr Ewen Cameron drugged patients and made them listen to recordings, sometimes thousands of times, in a process he called \"exploring\". Dr Cameron would make Ms Ponting listen to the same tape recording hundreds of times. \"It ran over and over again, you're a good girl, you're a bad girl,\" Ms Ponting recalled. The technique was a form of \"psychic driving,\" says doctoral student Jordan Torbay, who has researched his experiments and their ethical implications. \"Essentially the minds of patients were manipulated using verbal cues,\" she says, adding he also looked at the effects of sleep drugs, forced sensory deprivation, and induced coma. Medical records show Ms Ponting was given LSD, as well as drugs like sodium amytal, a barbiturate, desoxyn, a stimulant, as well as nitrous oxide gas, a sedative known as laughing gas. \"By April 30th, the patient had explorations… she had become quite tense and extremely violent when given the Nitrous Oxide, throwing herself half out of bed and starting to scream,\" Dr Cameron wrote in one of her medical files, which Ms Ponting has obtained through a freedom of information request. The harsh truth about the MK-Ultra experiments first came to light in the 1970s. Since then, several victims have tried to sue the US and Canada. Lawsuits in the US have largely been unsuccessful, but in 1988, a Canadian judge ordered the US government to pay nine victims $67,000 each. In 1992 the Canadian government paid C$100,000 (about $80,000 at the time) to each of 77 victims – but did not admit liability. Ms Ponting was not among them, because she did not yet know that she was a victim, she says For decades, Ms Ponting said she felt something was wrong with her, but she did not learn of the details of her own involvement in the experiments until somewhat recently. She says she had little memory of what happened at the Allan, or in the years that followed. Ms Ponting eventually married and moved to Manitoba, where she had two children whom she is still close to. Now, she's a grandmother to four grandchildren. But she says she has suffered life-long repercussions from her time at the Allan. \"I felt it all my life, because I was wondering why I would think this way, or, you know what happened to me,\" she said. She says she's had to be on a cocktail of medications her whole life to deal with mental-health issues, which she attributes to her time at the Allan, as well as recurrent nightmares. \"Sometimes I wake up screaming in the night because of what happened,\" she said. The Royal Victoria Hospital and McGill University declined to comment as the case is before the courts. The government pointed the BBC to its previous settlement, in 1992, which it said was done for \"humanitarian\" reasons and did not accept legal liability. For Ms Pointing, the lawsuit is a chance to finally get some closure. \"Sometimes I sit in my living room and my mind goes back, and I can think of the things that happened to me, you know,\" she says. \"Every time I see a picture of Dr Cameron, it makes me so angry.\" Although Dr Cameron's work has since become synonymous with MK-Ultra experiments, Ms Torbay says her research shows he didn't know he was being funded by the CIA at the time. His work with the US intelligence agency ended in 1964, and he died shortly after, of a heart attack, in 1967. But regardless of whether he knew of where the money was coming from, Ms Torbay says he should have known the experiments he was conducting were not ethical. She says she hopes the lawsuit goes forward, and the victims get some sense of justice. \"It isn't really about giving the patients back what they lost, because that's not possible, but sort of almost making sure their suffering wasn't in vain, that we do learn from this,\" she says."}

The record was held by Iceland, who reached the 2018 finals, but their country is far bigger than Curacao, which has a population of just over 150,000 (similar to Cambridge or Huddersfield) and a land area of 171 square miles, smaller than the Isle of Man. Former England boss McClaren resigned as Jamaica boss after his side, who needed a win in Kingston to qualify for their first World Cup since 1998, were held to a goalless draw, including having an injury-time penalty overruled by VAR. Curacao boss Dick Advocaat, who was not at the game for personal reasons, will become the oldest coach at a World Cup, aged 78, beating Otto Rehhagel's record when he was in charge of Greece aged 71 in 2010. Curacao, 37 miles off the Venezuela coast, only became a country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands in 2010, following the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles. Ten years ago they were 150th in Fifa's world rankings. Now they are 82nd. The expanded 2026 World Cup format, which features 48 nations instead of 32, along with the fact hosts Canada, Mexico and the United States all qualify automatically, has given Curacao a much-improved chance as they become the fourth debutant at next summer's tournament - joining Cape Verde, Uzbekistan and Jordan. \"It's crazy and would be one of the biggest things that will happen to Curacao,\" said midfielder Juninho Bacuna, a former Huddersfield, Rangers and Birmingham player before the match. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, he added: \"It's incredible and amazing. Even a few years ago you would not even think about it. \"To be personally part of it and to make that dream come true would be incredible.\" In 10 qualifying matches, they have won seven and finished their campaign unbeaten. Their fairytale looked shattered in the fourth of the five minutes added on at the end of the game when Curacao substitute Jeremy Antonisse appeared to have brought down Isaac Hayden and the El Salvador referee Ivan Barton immediately pointed to the spot. But the referee was quickly encouraged by the VAR officials to check the incident on the small touchline screen and reversed his own decision to the consternation of the crowd. They will be joined at the World Cup by Haiti and Panama from the Conacaf qualifying, with Jamaica having to go into the Intercontinental play-offs. The Caribbean Island of Haiti sealed their place at a first World Cup since 1974 after defeating Nicaragua 2-0. When is the 2026 World Cup draw? Since January 2024, Dutchman Advocaat, 78, has been in charge of his eighth national side after three spells with the Netherlands, as well as coaching the United Arab Emirates, South Korea, Belgium, Russia, Serbia and Iraq. He helped the Netherlands reach the quarter-finals of the 1994 World Cup and his South Korean team went out in the group phase in 2006. His list of clubs managed includes PSV Eindhoven, Rangers, Zenit St Petersburg, Sunderland and Feyenoord. Advocaat only became Curacao boss after a payment dispute between the players and the country's football association was resolved, and he immediately set his sights on qualifying for the 2026 World Cup. \"Everyone knows Dick Advocaat is a big name, he is a big coach and everyone respects him in his decisions and the way he works,\" added Bacuna. \"His presence is really important for us as a team and also for the country, and his impact has been really big. \"We started working with him in qualifying for the Nations League and we saw a growth in the team in the way we worked and the way we fought in games.\" Curacao fans celebrate in Jamaica As well as having a Dutch manager, the majority of players in the Curacao squad were born in the Netherlands but had family links that enabled them to play for Advocaat's side. Their squad includes Livingston defender Joshua Brenet, Rotherham midfielder Ar'jany Martha, Middlesbrough forward Sontje Hansen and Sheffield United midfielder Tahith Chong, who was born in Curacao and previously played in the Premier League with Manchester United. For Bacuna, playing for Curacao was also a chance to play international football with his older brother Leandro, the national side's captain, and that was a key part of his motivation after he had represented the Netherlands at under-21 level. \"I started to play for Curacao in 2019 and it was a big decision for me,\" said Juninho Bacuna. \"At that time I was only 21 and had a lot of years in front of me to see my chances for the Dutch national team. \"But I made a choice early to play for Curacao. One of the reasons was I can play in the same team as my brother and for the family to see us play together. \"The other reason was at the time my chances of playing for the Dutch national team, realistically, was not there. I saw a lot of players from my age already play for the Dutch national team but I didn't have a chance to be called up, so the choice was quick to make to play for Curacao.\" But Bacuna felt the country's recent footballing progress would inspire more Dutch-born players to represent the team known as The Blue Family. \"We're seeing more players that are still young and able to play for Holland and they come to play for Curacao - and make the team even stronger,\" added Bacuna.

Carl Peters said the no-single-entry policy after 21:00 had been in place since the opening of Alibi in Altrincham, Greater Manchester, in 2022. He told the BBC it was to \"mitigate risk\" and \"protect his customers\" from being \"mithered\" by solo drinkers. He posted a reel on Instagram earlier this month about the policy after saying someone had accused him of discrimination. He said he was \"astounded\" by the ensuing criticism, describing his venue as an \"inclusive and safe environment\". The ban got a mixed response from Instagram users with one commenter saying she \"always feels safe in Alibi\", while another described the policy as \"narrow minded\", adding if he finishes work late and goes for a drink himself \"he has never once mithered anyone and... happy in my own company\". Mr Peters explained there were two reasons why he introduced the policy. Firstly, if someone on their own has a seizure or an accident with no-one with them \"in a late night busy bar environment, it's an absolute nightmare for us to deal with\". He said also \"sometimes if you let people in on their own, the reason why they're on their own is that they've got no-one to talk to, so they start mithering other groups\". \"So what we do as a venue is we just eliminate that.\" He added: \"Unless you're with a group and we know who you're with, then you're not coming in.\" Mr Peters added he took \"pride that his customers feel safe in his venue\" so was \"astounded\" it was now being criticised on social media.

Sometimes compared to Game of Thrones, it features airborne fights, cuckolds, births, breakups and earthquakes, courtesy of its stars - the peregrine falcons who live at the top of a Melbourne skyscraper. Currently fans are waiting for the moment when this year's chicks, which began hatching at the end of September, attempt their first flight. They can be seen running up and down flapping their wings on the ledge – 34 storeys high – while their mother has been flying past with pigeons in her talons. \"She's teasing the chicks, going 'You wanna eat? Well you gotta fly',\" says Dr Victor Hurley, founder of the Victorian Peregrine Project. The goading and deliberate reduction in food encourages them to fly and helps them lose weight, he says. \"Their wings are growing and getting bigger and they get a better wing load ratio to wing load area so they can lift off easier.\" Dr Hurley was first tipped off to the peregrine nesting site on the office building at 367 Collins Street in 1991, the year he established the Victorian Peregrine Project, a volunteer group dedicated to the preservation of the species. But he realised the falcons were having no success because they had laid their eggs in a metal gutter, which acts as a heat sink, drawing warmth away from the nest. \"Rain gutters in winter in Melbourne, that was always going to end badly,\" he says. Dr Hurley recommended the building managers put in a nest box - which they agreed to do - and the following year three chicks were born.  A CCTV camera was put in to observe the nest in 1993 and every year at breeding time Dr Hurley would drag his large screen TV into the foyer so that people in the building could watch. Then in 2017 a webcam was installed and \"Nestflix\" was broadcast live on YouTube. The falcons also have their ownFacebook fan pagewith more than 50,000 members. \"It's quite a supportive corner of the internet where people just enjoy watching birds,\" says Kylie Humrick, who joined the group in 2017 and has since become one of its moderators. \"During Covid the group just exploded because it gave people a sense of connection to the world around them.\" \"We hear a lot about how wildlife is struggling and it's good to see some birds that are thriving in the built environment,\" she adds. A favourite moment was in 2021 when the livestream captured a falcon being startled off the nest by an earthquake. Over the years the nest has been inhabited by six or seven different pairs of falcons, possibly more. The piece of central Melbourne real estate is \"highly prized\" by the birds, Dr Hurley says. \"There's a guarantee of hot and cold running pigeons and sparrows all year round. So food's laid on for them.\" This, and the fact that peregrine falcons are extremely territorial - the closest they'll nest to each other is about 1.6km - has led to some spectacular fights over the nesting site with \"floaters\" - peregrines who haven't paired off or established their own territory - launching raids. In 2022, drama ensued when a male falcon (described as \"wimpy\" by Dr Hurley) was replaced by a younger bird halfway through the incubation period after a weeks-long battle. The older male was almost certainly killed by the \"step-father\" who was \"rubbish\" at his new incubation duties, says Dr Hurley, although he notes that at least he didn't eat the chicks when they hatched as has been known to happen and did in fact provide them with their first feed. \"People started referring to him as the dad that stepped up,\" says Ms Humrick. Then in 2023, the resident female falcon appeared to have sustained brain damage after getting \"beaten up\" by another female. \"She retained the territory for a couple of weeks but she was standing next to the eggs all night one night in winter so she was clearly not alright,\" says Dr Hurley. There were no chicks that year. Years earlier another female falcon was killed in a seven-hour fight that was so loud the building managers called Dr Hurley. Dr Hurley emphasises that these behaviours are natural and has rejected entreaties from falcon watchers to intervene. \"These things kill other birds for a living, that's their specialty and when they're taking over nests there's no prisoner abuse scandal, they just kill each other.\" Peregrine falcons, which were once nearly wiped out in Australia due to the use of pesticides in agriculture, have staged a recovery since the 1980s when DDT and other chemicals were banned. The birds - known as the fastest animals on earth, reaching speeds of up to 389km/h - are now to be found in almost every major city across the country, where tall buildings mimic the cliffs they prefer in nature. But they still face challenges, not least their first flight, which for the chicks at 367 Collins Street is expected any day soon. The male chick is expected to fly first, possibly as early as Saturday, followed around a week later by his two sisters. Female chicks are typically 30% heavier than their brothers, so they take a little longer to develop the necessary strength to fly. Dr Hurley hopes they all take their time as that means \"they'll be stronger and more capable\"; an ill-timed gust of wind could blow them into a window or they could land badly. One of last year's chicks had to spend several weeks at a rehabilitation centre after becoming trapped behind a glass balcony screen on another skyscraper. Once they make their first kill they'll be on their own, potentially chased out of the territory altogether depending on the ruthlessness of their parents. A 60% mortality rate in the first year means it's a \"tough gig\" being a young peregrine falcon, Dr Hurley observes, adding that such a rate is common among predators. \"If every lion that was born survived to become an adult and breed, you'd run out of zebra and wildebeest pretty quick.\" It's not clear what has happened to the earlier chicks from Collins Street despite up to 40 being banded, but they will usually travel tens of kilometres away to establish their own territories and avoid inbreeding. If they survive their second year - two thirds do not - they can begin breeding at three. Among the Facebook watchers excitement is building ahead of the expected fledging. \"Headed to Melbourne soon and binoculars already packed, hoping to spot them!\" one group member posted this week. \"Be still my freaked out heart,\" another wrote as one chick perched close to the edge of the ledge. \"It's always an exciting time in the group, viewership definitely goes up the closer we get to fledging. People look forward to seeing them go out into the world,\" says Ms Humrick. \"We don't know what happens to them after they fledge but it's nice to see them reach that milestone.\""}

Officials said the Queen Jenuvia 2 is stuck on a reef and unable to move, but there is currently no risk of it sinking or capsizing. The accident happened near Jangsan Island in Sinan County on Wednesday evening local time. The vessel ran aground on rocks near the uninhabited island of Jogdo. Twenty-seven people sustained minor injuries from the impact of the grounding, the Cost Guard said, but there have been no other casualties. Some passengers described the incident in real time on social media. \"There was a loud bang, and then the ship tilted,\" one was quoted as saying by South Korea's Yonhap news agency. \"An announcement told everyone to put on life jackets, so we're wearing them and waiting on the top deck.\" The 26,000-tonne ferry was travelling to the port city of Mokpo after departing from the resort island of Jeju, officials said. The area is near the site of the sinking of the Sewol ferry in 2014 thatkilled more than 300 people, mostly school children heading for a school trip. The salvaged wreck of the Sewol ferry was brought to Mokpo nearly three years later. Kim Namhyun, a diving instructor on Jeju Island, told Reuters: \"I thought I might die. The sound was too loud. \"But having seen the Sewol ferry, I knew that in situations like this, you have to stay calm, move outside, wear a life jacket, and wait.\" The Coast Guard plans to move the vessel ashore at high tide."}

Chanting and singing \"free the Amazon\", demonstrators in host city Belém have been carrying three giant coffins reading Oil, Coal and Gas flanked by two grim reapers. Indigenous groups displayed signs reading \"the answer is us\" as an inflatable elephant and anaconda weaved through the crowd under the hot sun. It is the first time since 2021 that protesters have been allowed to demonstrate outside the UN climate talks. The last three took place in countries that do not permit public protest. \"We are holding a funeral for fossil fuels,\" Tuga Cíntia told the BBC. She is from the theatre group Hydra Dance from the Federal University of Pará. \"I'm here because enough is enough with COP meetings and theory. It's time for us to actually act,\" she said. Indigenous communities, Brazilian youth groups, and activists from across the world joined the march in their thousands. As the midday sun intensified, some sought shelter in a petrol station forecourt. \"Fossil fuels are still being burned. We know all too well what it's like to live on the frontline of climate change,\" Brianna Fruean, a climate activist from Samoa, a low-lying island extremely vulnerable to climate change, told the BBC. \"We are here after so many COPS, marching for justice, for the end of fossil fuels,\" Ilan, from the non-governmental organisation 350, who lives in Brazil, said. Some carried signs reading \"demarcation now\", calling for indigenous groups to be given legal ownership of their territories. Hundreds of indigenous groups live in the Amazon and are regarded by experts as the best protectors of biodiversity and forests. Smaller sister protests have taken place around the world including in the UK. Security was tight at the COP30 venue as police with riot shields guarded the entrance. On Tuesdayprotesters carrying signs broke through security lines at the summit. The incident caused minor injuries to two security staff and some limited damage to the venue. Representation of indigenous voices has been a flashpoint in these talks, some of whom have set up stalls outside the fenced-off COP30 venue to sell products to passing delegates. The meeting was dubbed the \"indigenous people's COP\" but many groups feel their concerns over deforestation, land protection and resource extraction in their homes are not being heard. Negotiations continued at the COP30 talks on Saturday. Nearly 200 countries are meeting to try to make progress on tackling climate change. Little progress was made in the first week of the talks, although some delegations say they are pushing for an agreed strategy to deliver on past promises to move away from using planet-warming fossil fuels. President Luis Ignacio Lula da Silva of Brazil is hosting the talks and chose the city of Belém to put the world's focus on the Amazon. But shortly before the talks opened last week, his governmentgranted permission to the Brazilian state oil company to explore for oilat the mouth of the Amazon. On Friday, analysis of attendee lists by the coalition Kick Big Polluters Out (KBPO) suggested a record number of delegates from fossil fuel companies are attending the meeting. It suggests 1,600 lobbyists are in Belém, a 12% rise from the COP meeting last year. It is common for business leaders to come to the talks to strike deals. With the US strikingly absent from negotiations, progress has been slow. It is the first time the country has sent no delegation to the talks, after President Donald Trump branded climate change \"a con\". Earlier in the week a group of senior climate leaders wrote a letter calling on the summit to ensure the facts about climate change were \"upheld. Ten countries have signed an initiative called Declaration on Information Integrity on Climate Change at COP30, launched by the Global Initiative for Information Integrity on Climate Change. It aims to create international commitments to address climate disinformation and promote evidence-based information on climate issues. On the core issues of how to tackle the root cause of climate change and how to help countries adapt to ongoing global warming, Brazil has promised the talks will deliver action to implement years of deals and pledges. The talks continue into next week."}

A top lobby group for the food industry, FMI, the Food Industry Association, hailed the tariff rollback, which affected popular items like bananas and coffee, as a \"critical step\" toward affordability, as other business groups also praised the move. But in the end, the practical relief may not feel as monumental as the political gesture. In October, the Budget Lab at Yale projected that Trump's tariffs this year - currently a baseline tax of 10% on imports from all countries, with additional levies on many trading partners - would drive up food prices 1.9% in the short run. The impact would be significant, given that US grocery prices historically have been relatively stable, rising an average of only 2% a year between 2013 and 2021. The White House order did not eliminate tariffs on all food, but it removed levies on some items, such as coffee, spices and tropical fruit like bananas, for which US production is negligible or non-existent. For those kinds of goods, economists and businesses said they expected the order would help bring down prices - and relatively quickly. Anthony Serafino, president of the New Jersey-based fruit importer and distributor EXP Group, said he expected to drop his prices in the coming weeks, after raising them earlier this year to cover millions of dollars in new tariff costs. He said it might take a few weeks for shoppers to see the difference, since he has to sell items he brought in before the change. But he expected the decision to be a \"big help\". \"We were just passing through costs. We're not going to keep prices elevated just to keep prices elevated,\" he said. The overall impact on household grocery budgets, however, may still end up feeling relatively modest. Though the US is heavily dependent on foreign supplies in certain categories, such as fresh fruit and seafood, imports typically account for less than 20% of overall food and beverage purchases by Americans, according to USDA. And many food imports from Mexico - America's single biggest foreign food supplier - were already spared tariffs, due to White House exemptions for goods covered by a US, Mexico and Canada free trade agreement. \"You will certainly see it on certain products,\" said Sean Cash, a professor of food economics at Tufts University.  \"I don't think we're going to see a lot in terms of the average price of groceries coming down.\" Food companies are still facing higher costs from tariffs on materials like aluminium, used to make canned foods; items like wine, cheese and palm oil did not make the list. Recent jumps in food prices also reflect factors unrelated to tariffs, like rising labour costs and droughts, which hit coffee and cattle supplies. \"If we got rid of trade barriers on food items and food commodities, would that make food cheaper in the US? Yes, a little bit, but not that much, because most of what we're buying are services,\" said Daniel Sumner, a professor of agricultural economics at the University of California, Davis, noting costs like border inspections, washing, trucking fees and supermarket workers. Overall, grocery prices climbed 2.7% over the 12 months to September. That is still significantly lower than the huge jumps in 2022 and 2023, when grocery prices surged 11.4% and 5% respectively. Trump administration officials have cast high food prices as a mess they inherited from the Biden administration, and warned it will take time to correct the problem. In a briefing for reporters last week about new tariff exemptions, they acknowledged the effects might be limited, saying reducing prices in grocery aisles was the goal and not a guarantee. Walmart, Target and Kroger did not respond to requests for comment. Food prices tend to fluctuate more than other kinds of goods, meaning some relief is likely, especially given attention on the issue, economists said. But Sylvain Charlebois, director of the Agri-Food Analytics Lab at Dalhousie University in Canada, warned today's high prices are likely to inform future decisions, comparing the dynamic to the \"tide\". \"The tide goes up, it leaves a mark on the dock and that line remains,\" he said. \"If tariffs disappear, you will see that mental mark remaining and industry tends to work with that mark.\""}

The 65-year-old learned he would lose his home in Thetford, Norfolk, during a brisk 10-minute county court hearing earlier this year. The interest-only mortgage on the three-bedroom property was taken out more than 20 years ago in the hope he and his then wife would save up enough to eventually cover the capital sum. But the collapse of the marriage and his ex-wife's departure to Brazil in 2015, left Mr Da Costa Diogo unable to repay the £80,000 still outstanding. And because his ex-wife was still on both the mortgage documents and the property deeds, he was also unable to sell the property to cover the outstanding amount. \"I tried to do the right thing and carried on paying all the bills,\" he said. \"After 25 years, I have nothing to show... but I still have to carry on living. Court figuresshow the number of mortgage repossession orders in England and Wales reached 10,853 in 2024-25- the highest number in five years. Experts say the rise is down to a variety of factorsincluding interest rate increasesand the rise in the general cost of living. Mr Da Costa Diogo registered as homeless with Breckland Council, his local authority. The BBC asked every English council with housing responsibilities how many people presented as homeless as a result of a mortgage repossession. The number has doubled, according to the 240 councils that provided comparable data - from 1,517 in 2022-23, to 2,370 in 2023-24. It was 3,406 in the most recent year. LIVE: Five minutes to fight for your home: BBC reports from repossession cases across England People in local government say rehoming those affected by repossessions is putting ever greater stress on council resources. Tom Hunt, who chairs the Local Government Association's Inclusive Growth Board, said: \"As more and more people turn to their council for help, local authorities are having to stretch budgets further. \"The temporary accommodation crisis facing councils is only worsening.\" Lucy Davies sees the devastation repossessions can have on a daily basis. A housing law advisor with the Suffolk Law Centre, she volunteers her expertise to those in need at courts in Suffolk and Essex. \"I see the sheer number of people that this is affecting,\" said Ms Davies. \"People get into difficulties largely through no fault of their own. \"Quite often there's mental health, there's employment issues, there's family issues, and I think it can very quickly spiral out of control.\" On the day the BBC joined Ms Davies for a day at Ipswich County Court, where she volunteers with the Ipswich County Court Advice and Representation Service, none of the five people facing mortgage repossession cases turned up. This, she said, was often a symptom of shame, despair and the sense that losing one's home is a foregone conclusion. \"It is quite frightening coming to court, but it doesn't have to be.\" She urged people to seek advice as soon as possible and said the cases she was seeing were becoming \"more entrenched or more serious\". People were finding it increasingly difficult to access housing legal aid, she explained. Paul Gorton, of The Law Society's housing law committee, agreed. He said a historic lack of investment in legal aid meant fewer and fewer law firms were able to offer legal aid housing advice. \"Many people are too well off to be eligible for legal aid but cannot afford to pay for legal advice themselves,\" Mr Gorton said. \"We have both legal aid provider deserts and restrictive eligibility criteria leaving many people stuck in limbo.\" A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said it had recently announced \"the first major funding increase for housing legal aid in three decades - a 24% rise\". \"This investment will help ensure effective access to justice for some of the most vulnerable in our society, while supporting a more stable and sustainable legal aid sector,\" the spokesperson said. Seeking to repossess a home is \"always a last resort\" for lenders, said Karina Hutchins, a principal in the mortgage policy team at UK Finance, a trade association for the banking and financial services sector. She said while the number of mortgage repossessions had been creeping up in recent years, the current levels remained \"historically low\". \"Repossessions are really, really uncommon.\" She said in the first quarter of 2025, about 2,000 homes were repossessed compared with 13,000 in the same quarter of 2009, in the wake of the 2008 financial crash. \"I can imagine that customers are really worried and distressed if they're facing financial difficulty, but they don't have to go through it alone,\" Ms Hutchins said. \"The earlier they get in touch with their mortgage lender, the more support and help that that lender can give them and the more likelihood they have of getting back up to date with their mortgage.\" Options offered by lenders, she said, included reduced mortgage payments to allow time to get back on track, budgeting and other tools to understand \"their full financial situation\" and advice about debt charities and support organisations. Henry Sabati McRae, who lives in Croydon, south London, has so far managed to stave off repossession. A software developer by training, Mr McRae's financial woes came in the wake of the death of a brother in 2020 and his mother in October 2023. Since October 2024, the 51-year-old has been out of work and, despite applying for hundreds of jobs, he has not managed to get a new contract. \"It doesn't matter how much you have in savings,\" he said. \"Within a few months it is wiped out. I managed to stretch it as far as I could, because I'd been quite conservative with how I was doing.\" Even so, the mortgage arrears on his two-bedroom flat eventually grew to about £13,000 and his bank said if that figure was not reduced to below £8,000 it would seek to repossess his home. \"The most important thing for me at that time, and I think for anybody, was keeping the roof over my head,\" he said. \"Otherwise it spirals out of control.\" To scrape by, he has turned to selling off his possessions on an internet auction site and accepting a loan from a friend. Like many of those facing repossession action the BBC has spoken to, Mr McRae said the experience was deeply \"humiliating\" and that his instincts were initially \"to draw the curtains shut\". However, he said realising he was far from alone and in speaking about it has helped him plot out, like an IT problem, his \"solution to it\". Businessman Mike Williams, who lives 10 miles (16km) south of Mr McRae in Caterham, Surrey, has also avoided repossession. He took on the mortgage of his self-build home after he and his wife separated. In three years, repayments on the interest-only loan, which was taken out 20 years ago, have tripled. He says it has left him with \"next to no disposable income\". At court, he renegotiated a repayment plan which would add an extra 20% to his monthly payments. In five years, when the mortgage comes to term, he intends to sell the two-bedroom house which he and his wife built from the ground up. \"It has quite a bit of sentimental value to me, so yes it is heart-wrenching,\" he said. As for Mr Da Costa Diogo, his bank has repossessed the property. In the same month it was repossessed, the BBC saw a similar three-bedroom property in the same Thetford street as Mr Da Costa Diogo's on the market for £160,000 - almost double the amount he owed. Within hours of losing his home, he was given emergency accommodation in a small ground-floor studio in north Suffolk. \"I left my house with one suitcase and a bag of essentials and told the council 'I'm homeless'. \"It's a roof over my head. I'm trying to keep things simple because what is the point of complicating things? With additional reporting by Zoe Dennis, Stephen Menon, Jonathan Fagg and Stuart Bailey.

With the help of CricViz, we look at where the most eagerly-anticipated Ashes series in years could be won and lost. The final frontier: Why has Root never made a century down under? Who are TMS pundits' Ashes players to watch? 'He'd have lit up like a Christmas tree' - McGrath on scans, Bazball & Australia Batters on each side of the Ashes divide might be wondering why they are bothering to turn up. A lot of the build-up has centred around the perceived difficulty of scoring runs, particularly for the first Test on a Perth pitch the West Australian newspaper has called a \"green monster\". When it comes to batting in Australia, particularly against pace bowling (we'll come to spin later), no country has been harder in which to score runs over the past five years. There are two reasons for this: pitches and balls. Taken as a collective, the surfaces prepared in Australia have recently proved to be the fastest, most bouncy and among the most inconsistent in the world. Pace and inconsistent bounce are the perfect recipe for tough batting. A long-standing narrative from English cricket paints the Kookaburra ball used in this country as a useless tool for a pace bowler. A new version of the Kookaburra was introduced six years ago, resulting in more seam movement - seam is a much bigger weapon than swing in this country. Since the new Kookaburra was introduced, pace bowlers are averaging 25 runs per wicket in Australia. Test cricket is about problem solving. When the ball is on top, performances of batters can be the difference, and vice-versa. If this Ashes is dominated by the ball, a batter could have the opportunity to be the difference between the two teams. For once, England have arrived in Australia with their pace attack largely intact, while the home side are the ones hit by injuries. Captain Pat Cummins willmiss at least the first Testwith a back injury, and Josh Hazlewood ison the sidelines for an unknown periodbecause of a hamstring problem. Cummins, Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc were first united as a trio for the 2017-18 Ashes series. Since then, they have combined to claim 81% of the wickets taken by Australia pace bowlers in home Tests. Australia have rarely had to look elsewhere because of the success and robustness of the 'big three'. When Australia have needed a back-up, Scott Boland has been sensational, taking 62 wickets in 14 Tests at an average below 17. Boland takes 6-7 as he rips through England on debut Aside from Boland, other members of Australia's supporting cast have stepped up. Michael Neser, Jhye Richardson and James Pattinson all average below 30 in home Tests. The last time Australia went into a home Test without Cummins and Hazlewood, and lost, was in 2012. The past two times they have played at home without the pair, they have won by a combined 694 runs, including against England in Adelaide four years ago. On the rare occasions Australia have had to look beyond their superstar pacemen, results have not been affected - England should take heed. Remember when England could not find an opener to go alongside Alastair Cook? Sir Chef went through partners faster than Watford go through managers. No more. Since Ben Duckett and Zak Crawley were united at the top of the England order at the end of 2022, no batting partnership in the world has produced more runs together. Their success as a combination has been a factor in Crawley being backed through some inconsistent times. The Kent man, who memorably hit the first ball of the last Ashes series for four, has also been identified as having the game for Australia. His batting average increases when the bowling gets faster. By contrast, Australia's top order is in a constant state of flux, yet to fill the David Warner-shaped hole. Following Warner's retirement at the beginning of 2024, Usman Khawaja has walked out with five different partners in 15 Tests. Uncapped Jake Weatherald looks set to become the sixth in 16 on Friday, giving Australia an all-left-handed opening combo - sure to attract the attention of leftie hunter Jofra Archer. It is not just the opening pair that has caused problems for Australia. Marnus Labuschagne, Australia's long-term number three, was shifted to open for the World Test Championship final, then left out completely. Domestic form has earned him a recall, most likely back at three. In seven Tests across 2025, Australia's top three average a collective 25.37 - only the top threes of Zimbabwe and West Indies have performed worse. For two so evenly-matched teams, there is one area where Australia are unquestionably superior - spin. Australia's Nathan Lyon, all 562 Test wickets of him, is one of the finest finger-spinners to play the game. England's Shoaib Bashir is a moderately successful selection punt, looking short of form after a broken finger, while Will Jacks is primarily a batter. It would seem logical for the hosts to want Lyon at the forefront, but bowling spin has been incredibly hard work in Australia for the past 10 years. In that time, spinners have averaged almost 44 in this country, albeit Lyon's record largely stands up compared to the struggles of visiting tweakers. Lyon's other issue is physically getting on to bowl. Remember the effectiveness of pace bowling? It is reducing Lyon's time with ball in hand. In the 2017-18 Ashes here, Lyon was averaging 50 overs per Test. Last year, in five Tests against India, it was half that number. Tests in Australia are lasting about 25% less time since the new Kookaburra was introduced, meaning Lyon has less space to make an impact. England have a depressing habit of being beaten in an away Ashes before Father Christmas has loaded his sleigh. The series traditionally started in Brisbane, where they have not won since 1986. Recently, that has been followed by a day-night Test in Adelaide - England have one win in seven pink-ball Tests worldwide, while Australia have won 13 out of 14. Then on to Perth, a city England have visited 14 times since 1970 and emerged victorious only once, against aPacker-ravaged Australiain 1978. This time the first three stops on the tour are the same, only in a different order and under different circumstances. Perth has hosted an Ashes opener before but this will be the first time it will not be at the fabled Waca - scene of many an England humbling - but the shiny new Perth Stadium. It remains a tough assignment, though one the tourists tackle with no historical baggage. Brisbane is the venue for the second Test, the day-nighter. The last time Australia played a pink-ball Test at the Gabba, they were stunned by West Indies. Similarly, the Aussies are now unaccustomed to playing day matches at the usual day-night venue Adelaide. In the two red-ball matches played in the City of Churches since 2014, Australia lost one, to India, in 2018. The re-jigged schedule gives England a fresh attempt at starting an away Ashes well, albeit with pitfalls. Australia have won four of the five Tests played at Perth Stadium, though the one defeat came in the most recent match - against India last year. Every Test at the new ground has been won by the team batting first. England often complicate day-night matches, when statistics suggest the pink ball does not perform much differently from its red counterpart. The issue in day-night matches is batters seeing the ball under floodlights. It is therefore questionable why England are sending a Lions team to play the Prime Minister's XI under the lights in Canberra between the first and second Tests, when the Ashes squad could be gaining valuable practice.

The company says it plans to use the money from investors, including an arm of Wall Street banking giant Goldman Sachs, to open more shops and expand around the world. \"We can't wait to take Skims to the next level as we continue to innovate and set the standard for our industry,\" Kardashian said on Wednesday. The funding round is one of the biggest this year for a US consumer brand and comes as Skims faces fierce competition from rivals like Lululemon. Skims, which runs 18 shops in the US and sells its products through retailers worldwide, will focus \"predominantly\" on its physical retail business over the next few years, it saidin a statement. The company expects its sales to top $1bn this year, which Skims chief executive Jens Grede said gave the firm the confidence to pursue its long-term goals. The brand debuted in 2019 with a line of shapewear and has since broadened its range to include loungewear and other fashion categories. The company's growth has moved it deeper into the mainstream sports and athleisure market, which is largely dominated by brands like Lululemon and Alo Yoga. Skims has also amassed a large pool of influencers, including the Kardashians and other celebrities like Megan Fox and Paris Hilton to boost its appeal. Since its launch the company has faced some controversies. Its initial name, Kimono Intimates, was criticised for disregarding the significance of the traditional Japanese outfit,prompting the company to come up with another name - Skims. One Skims product -a head wrap worn during sleep- split the internet. Some hailed it as the future of non-invasive face contouring, but others condemned it as dystopian, and said the firm was making women feel more insecure."}

A common bacterium was genetically engineered to eat a plastic-derived molecule and then digest itto produce the everyday painkiller, paracetamol. The microbe used by Stephen Wallace, professor of chemical biotechnology at the University of Edinburgh, was Escherichia coli, better known as E. coli. The rod-shaped bacterium is found in the intestines of humans and animals, and you might be more familiar with it as an unpleasant bugthat can make us ill. Prof Wallace chose it automatically because certain strains of E. coli that aren't pathogenic are used extensively in biotechnology and engineering biology laboratories to test whether something might work. E. coli is the field's main \"workhorse\" says Prof Wallace, who has also genetically engineered it in the lab to turn plastic waste into vanilla flavour and fatberg waste from sewers into perfume. \"If you want to prove something is possible with biology, E.coli is a natural first stage,\" he says. The microbe's use isn't just confined to the lab. Industrially, vats of genetically engineered E. coli act like living factories producing a variety of products from pharmaceuticals like insulin, vital for diabetes management, to various platform chemicals used to make fuels and solvents. But how did E. coli come to be such a mainstay of biotechnology, why is it so useful and what might its future hold? E. coli's dominance stems from its role as a model organism for understanding general biological principles, says Thomas Silhavy, a professor of molecular biologist at Princeton University, who has been performing studies in the bacterium for about 50 years and hasdocumented its history. Other familiar model organisms include mice, fruit flies and baker's yeast. Yeast, like E. coli, has also become an invaluable tool in biotechnology, both in the lab and industrially – but it has a more complex cell structure and different applications. E. coli was first isolated in 1885 by a German paediatrician, Theodor Escherich, studying infant gut microbes. Fast growing and easy to work with, scientists began to use it to study basic bacterial biology. Then in the 1940s, \"serendipity\" catapulted it into the big time, says Prof Silhavy. A non-pathogenic E. coli strain (K-12) was used to demonstrate bacteria did not just divide, but could undergo 'bacterial sex' where they share and recombine genes to gain new traits. It was a landmark discovery and E. coli became the \"very favourite organism of everybody\", he says. It saw E. coli go on to play a central role in many more discoveries and milestones in genetics and molecular biology. It was used to help decipher the genetic code, and in the 1970s it became the first organism to be genetically engineered when foreign DNA was inserted into it – laying the foundation for modern biotechnology. It also solved a problem with insulin production. Insulin from cattle and pigs had been used to treat diabetes, but caused allergic reactions in some patients. But in 1978the first synthetic human insulinwas produced using E. coli, a huge breakthrough. In 1997, it became one of the first organisms to have its entire genome sequenced, making it easier to understand and manipulate. Adam Feist, a professor at the University of California, San Diego who evolves microbes for industrial applications, says he appreciates E. coli for its many useful features. Beyond the vast knowledge accumulated about its genetics and the tools that make it easy to engineer, the bacterium grows quickly and predictably on a wide variety of substrates. It isn't \"finicky\" like some, can be frozen and revived without trouble, and is unusually good at hosting foreign DNA. \"The more I work with more microorganisms, the more I appreciate just how robust E. coli is,\" he says. Cynthia Collins is a senior director at Ginkgo Bioworks, a company that helps firms develop their biotech products, and has assisted them in using E. coli industrially. While the menu of organisms available for large-scale manufacturing is somewhat broader than it was a few decades ago – when E. coli was often the only choice – it can frequently still be a \"good choice\" depending on the product, says Dr Collins. (Even with the most intensive bioengineering, E. coli can't produce everything). \"It's very economical; you can pump out a lot,\" she says, noting that if the bacterium is producing something toxic to the cells, tolerance can often be engineered in. Yet there are some who wonder if E. coli's dominance might be stifling us from finding the very best biotech solutions for our problems. Paul Jensen, a microbiologist and engineer at the University of Michigan, studies bacteria that live in our mouths.He recently analysedjust how understudied most other bacteria have been relative to E. coli. His point is while we are forging ahead with ever more extensive  engineering of E. coli to do remarkable things, there could be other microbes out there that do those things naturally – and better – that aren't getting a look in and we are missing out on benefitting from because they aren't being sought out or studied. Bioprospecting in landfills, for example, might turn up microbes that have started eating not only plastic but all sorts of other waste, he says.  And there could be bacteria out there that do things – like making cement or rubber – we haven't even imagined. Just the bacteria that live in our mouths outshine E. coli for acid tolerance he notes. \"We are just so deep with E. coli that we are not investigating enough,\" he says. There are some alternatives people are working on to increase options – including Vibrio natriegens (V. nat), which has begun to gain attention as a potential competitor to E. coli. V. nat was first isolated from a salt marsh in the US state of Georgia back in the 1960s but remained largely neglected in culture collections and freezers until the mid-2010s when it was recognized for its ultra-fast growth rate – twice that of E. coli – which could be a significant industrial advantage. It is also far more efficient at taking in foreign DNA, says Buz Barstow, a biological and environmental engineer at Cornell University, who is among those developing the organism, and says its capability compared to E. coli is like \"going from a horse to a car\". Driving Dr Barstow's V. nat focus is he wants to see microbes used to tackle big sustainability challenges – from producing jet fuel from carbon dioxide and green electricity to mining rare earth metals. \"Simply put, E. coli won't get us to any of these visions. V. natriegens might,\" he says. This year his lab spun out a company, Forage Evolution, which is working on tools to make it easier for researchers to engineer it in the lab. V. nat does offer attractive properties, Prof Feist acknowledges, but those genetic tools needed for broad use are, as yet, missing, and it has yet to prove itself at scale. \"E. coli is a tough thing to replace,\" he says."}

The show is an adaptation of Suzanne Collins' bestselling dystopian novels, made into a film franchise starring Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson, in which teenagers are selected to fight to the death in a televised spectacle. The £26m Troubadour Canary Wharf Theatre, with arena-style seating, placing  audiences in different \"districts\", has been built to allow for sweeping visuals, immersive projections and dramatic aerial sequences. At one point Katniss, played by Mia Carragher, and Peeta, played by Euan Garrett, fly over the stage in a chariot on fire. While critics, including The Stage, praised the show's ambition and technical wizardry, some expressed reservations about whether the story packed enough of an emotional punch. A two-star review by the Financial Timessaid it was visually energetic but lacked \"a beating heart\". \"There's little emotional impact - we are watching children die and that should hit hard, but it doesn't,\" Sarah Hemming wrote. But The Stage's Holly O'Mahony called the show \"ambitious and spectacular. Herfour-star reviewsaid there is \"plenty here to impress fans of the franchise, and the space is used in its entirety.\" The Independent's three-star reviewpraised Carragher for her athletic and impressive stage debut. Alice Saville agreed said the show has \"all the bells, bangs and whistles you'd expect – but it misses the point of her story\". A two-star review by Clive Davis in The Timessaid the arena looks impressive when you arrive, but once the action starts you realise the show \"struggles to fill it with enough spectacle to justify the steep prices\". The cast, including newcomer Carragher, who is the daughter of ex-Liverpool footballer Jamie Carragher, were praised for their performances. Davis said she is an \"energetic central presence\" and \"Garrett wins our sympathy\". The Guardian's three-star reviewfrom Arifa Akbar said the show is \"all spectacle above emotion\", adding: \"You don't feel the dread in Conor McPherson's adaptation, which seems clipped by the pace of events.\" But the Telegraph's Claire Alfree called the show a \"depressingly bad adaptation\" of the young adult books. Her two-star reviewsaid director Matthew Dunster, who has also directed shows including 2:22 - A Ghost Story, failed to \"reimagine and revitalise its source material\". The play has kept true to the books, and producer Tristan Baker said it was important to not have any plot changes, but there \"are lots of Easter Eggs and some wonderful surprises if you know the world\". Garrett, who plays Peeta, told the BBC it's important for the show \"not to be compared\" with the books because \"it's a reimagining of its own entity\". He added that Collins came to watch a rehearsal recently and \"she loved it\". \"To have her stamp of approval and blessing was a real honour,\" he said. Performances have tightened since previews started in mid-October, when early shows were branded \"chaotic\" and \"messy\" by some theatregoers, who reported long queues, delays and visible signs that parts of the venue were not completed. The show's producer, Oliver Royds, told the BBC there are \"always teething issues with shows of this magnitude\" and the team \"were slightly disappointed we didn't get it right from the very get-go\". \"We did mess up on the first night with a few issues,\" he said, adding those issues have now been rectified, and those affected by the first couple of shows have been invited back. Talking about the building process, Royds called it a \"DIY makeover on steroids\" and said 42,000 pieces of steel had to craned into the theatre, with thousands of people coming together to make it happen. Carragher, 21, told the BBC that the show is a real technical challenge. \"There are so many parts of the stage that open up,\" she said. \"If you put something in the wrong place, it affects the next scene. You've got to be thinking ahead of yourself so much.\" Garrett added that the emotional intensity of his performance had to run in parallel with technical precision. \"You're in an intense scene, giving everything, but you've still got to remember what needs clipping on or where a prop has to be, and making that seamless and not noticeable is the struggle.\" The show is also very physically demanding – there are the non-stop combat sequences, rapid sprints across the stage and tightly timed stunts. \"We've got to be really comfortable with each other and trust that that they're going to move out of the way when you hit them, at the very last minute,\" Carragher says. \"It needs to be believable because when we do it safe, it doesn't look as good.\""}

Finucane, 22, reached the quarter-finals in the sprint event on Friday but anerror saw the two-time defending champion miss outon a spot in the semi-finals. The three-time Olympic medallist put that frustration behind her to finish second behind Japan's Mina Sato in the keirin. \"I'm really proud,\" Finucane said. \"After the sprint, I was really gutted and it took me a while to process it, but I think bouncing back and doing four rides that I didn't think even six months ago that I was capable of doing, I've grown so much and we'll keep working on it. \"I can take a lot [from this World Championships]. They say the highs when you're winning things is sweet, but you can only feel that when you get the sour. \"It's year one of the cycle, I've so much more growing [to do].\" The keirin remains the only sprint event in which Finucane - who in 2024 became the first British woman since 1964 to win three medals at the same Olympics - is yet to claim a major gold. Her silver was one of four for the British team on the final day of the Championships in Santiago. Morris sprints 'like a champion' to take silver in women's points race Earlier in the day, Anna Morris picked up her third medal of the Championships with a perfectly-timed final sprint in the women's points race. Morris added to her individual pursuit gold and bronze in the team pursuit. \"I'm really, really happy. I wasn't sure when it finished - I thought it was top five but my coach told me I was second,\" Morris said. \"It has been a solid week on the whole.\" Meanwhile, Matt Richardson - whoswitched allegiancefrom Australia to Great Britain last year - also took home a silver medal on the final day after coming up short against long-time rival Harrie Lavreysen of the Netherlands in the men's sprint final. Lavreysen won the first race by 0.094secs and was 0.050secs clear of Richardson in the second to seal his seventh consecutive world championship gold in the event. In the men's madison, Mark Stewart and Josh Tarling placed second behind Belgian duo Lindsay de Vylder and Fabio van den Bossche, amassing 73 points - eight fewer than the champions - in the 200-lap race. That took Great Britain's final medal haul to 14 - winning four gold, eight silver and two bronze - but they finished second to the Netherlands in the overall table. Speaking to BBC Sport, GB sprint coach and seven-time Olympic champion Sir Jason Kenny said: \"We've missed out on some medals that we felt we could have been competitive for, but we've come away with a really good haul with some new medallists, so it's really exciting. \"The fact that we were on the podium more than ever shows that we were competitive across the board, and it's really positive. \"Next year's World Championships will go towards Olympic qualification so things will start getting really serious, and I think given the age profile of the team - and the fact that we are so competitive in so many events - is a really good place to start the Olympic journey.\""}

They say another 73 people were wounded, 15 of them children, in the strike early on Wednesday - one of the deadliest in the region since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. Ukraine's air force later said Russian X-101 cruise missiles had hit the residential flats. The neighbouring Lviv and Ivano-Frankivsk regions were also struck, and a drone attack on three districts of the north-eastern city of Kharkiv wounded more than 30 people. Photos posted online showed buildings and cars ablaze. Ukraine's air force said it had shot down 442 of 476 drones and 41 of 48 missiles launched by Russia, including 10 missiles destroyed by F-16 and Mirage 2000 fighter jets supplied to Kyiv by its Western allies. But in a reference to how stretched Ukraine's air defences currently are, the air force pleaded for \"the uninterrupted and timely supply of aviation weapons from Western partners\". Ternopil, a city closer to the Polish border than the capital Kyiv, has rarely faced attacks since the full-scale invasion. Social media footage of this strike shows missiles shooting across the sky towards the city, though very little sign of air defences reacting from the ground. The devastation caused by the Russian strikes on Ternopil soon became clear. A video shared by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky showed one of the blocks of flats had completely caved in. Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said it had been destroyed between the third and ninth floors. The attack had caused \"significant destruction\", said Zelensky, and many victims were reported to be in the rubble. Plumes of smoke poured from windows and small fires burned outside the tenement. A giant smoke cloud rose in the distance behind the Church of Our Lady of Perpetual Help in Ternopil, as sirens blared throughout the city. With limited defence systems, and a vast country to defend every night, no matter how effective Ukraine becomes at shooting down Russian missiles and drones, there is always a risk some will get through – to devastating effect, as happened in Ternopil. Energy facilities, transport and civil infrastructure were damaged elsewhere in western Ukraine. The energy sector came under attack in Ivano-Frankivsk region where two of the three people reported wounded were children. The head of Lviv region said an energy facility had been struck. Russia has recently upped its attacks on Ukraine's energy grid - as the fourth winter of the war approaches - hoping to damage morale as well as logistics and Ukraine's own defence industry. Electrical supplies are already being rationed and, after the latest attacks, the energy ministry announced more power cuts across the country. Russia's defence ministry said it had carried out its \"massive strike using long-range precision weapons\", claiming it had targeted Ukraine's \"military-industrial complex and energy sector\" in response to Ukrainian attacks on \"civilian targets\". Ukraine's military said on Tuesday it had fired US-supplied longer-range Atacms missiles at military targets inside Russia, the first time they had admitted using Atacms on Russian soil. Russia's defence ministry accused Ukraine of firing four of the missiles at the southern city of Voronezh but said they had all been shot down by air defences. Meanwhile, Zelensky has travelled to the Turkish capital Ankara, in an attempt to revive a US bid to end the war. He held talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan amid reports President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff has been working on a plan with Russian counterpart Kirill Dmitriev. The Kremlin said earlier that no Russian representative would be joining the talks in Ankara. Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman appeared to dismiss US media reports that Washington and Moscow had been working on a peace plan for Ukraine - without any involvement of Kyiv and its European allies. \"In this case, we have no additional innovations to what we call 'the spirit of Anchorage',\" Dmitry Peskov told Russia's state-run media, referring to the August summit between Putin and Trump in the US state Alaska. Any agreements reached during the one-day meeting have not been made public. Peskov's comments came as Zelensky was reportedly due to meet two top US army officials in Kyiv on Thursday. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll and Army Chief of Staff General Randy George are the most senior US military officials to visit the Ukrainian capital since President Donald Trump took office, Reuters reports. In a separate development, Romania's defence ministry said a Russian drone had flown about 8km (5 miles) through its airspace in the early hours of Wednesday. The drone then crossed into Ukraine and Moldova before returning to Romania, it said. Romanian and German air force planes were scrambled in response to the incursion and the defence ministry said it was unclear where the drone had come down. Poland also deployed jets early on Wednesday and temporarily closed two airports in the southeast in response to the strikes in western Ukraine. As the fourth anniversary of the start of Russia's full-scale invasion approaches next February, Moscow and Kyiv remain fundamentally opposed in their views of how to end the war. Ukraine and its Western allies, including the US, have called for an immediate ceasefire along the vast front line – but Russia has repeatedly ruled that out, repeating demands that Ukraine says amount to its de facto capitulation. Earlier this month, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow's pre-conditions for a peace deal - including tough curbs on the size of Ukraine's military and the country's neutrality - had not changed since Putin laid them out two months before the full-scale invasion."}

Here are some tips'. It was like a cheerleader on my side, like I was right and he was wrong.\" Overall, she says it was \"useful\" but described the language as \"very much like therapy speak, using words like 'boundaries'\". \"All I took from it was it reminded me to be OK to do it on my terms, but I didn't take it too literally.\" Rachel is not alone in turning to AI for advice in dealing with relationships. According to research by theonline dating firm Match, almost half of Generation Z Americans (those born between 1997 and 2012) said they have used LLMs like ChatGPT for dating advice, that's more than any other generation. People are turning to AI to help craft breakup messages, to dissect conversations they're having with people they're dating, and to resolve problems in relationships. Dr Lalitaa Suglani, psychologist and relationship expert, says AI can be a useful tool, especially for people who feel overwhelmed or unsure when it comes to communication in relationships. It may help them to craft a text, process a confusing message or source a second opinion, which can offer a moment of pause instead of being reactive, she says. \"In many ways it can function like a journalling prompt or reflective space, which can be supportive when used as a tool and not a replacement for connection,\" says Dr Suglani. However, she flags several concerns. \"LLMs are trained to be helpful and agreeable and repeat back what you are sharing, so they may subtly validate dysfunctional patterns or echo back assumptions, especially if the prompt is biased and the problem with this it can reinforce distorted narratives or avoidance tendencies.\" For example, she says, using AI to write a breakup text might be a way to avoid the discomfort of the situation. That might contribute to avoidant behaviours, as the individual is not sitting with how they actually feel. Using AI might also inhibit their own development. \"If someone turns to an LLM every time they're unsure how to respond or feel emotionally exposed, they might start outsourcing their intuition, emotional language, and sense of relational self,\" says Dr Suglani. She also notes that AI messages can be emotionally sterile and make communication feel scripted, which can be unnerving to receive. Despite the challenges, services are springing up to serve the market for relationship advice. Mei is a free AI generated service. Trained using Open AI, the service responds to relationship dilemmas with conversational-like responses. \"The idea is to allow people to instantly seek help to navigate relationships because not everyone can talk to friends or family for fear of judgment,\" says New York-based founder Es Lee. He says more than half of the issues brought up on the AI tool concern sex, a subject that many may not wish to discuss with friends or a therapist, Mr Lee says. \"People are only using AI as existing services are lacking,\" he says. Another common use is how to reword a message or how to fix an issue in a relationship. \"It's like people need AI to validate it [the problem].\" When giving relationship advice, issues of safety could come up. A human counsellor would know when to intervene and protect a client from a potentially harmful situation. Would a relationship app provide the same guardrails? Mr Lee recognises the concern over safety. \"I think the stakes are higher with AI because it can connect with us on a personal level the way no other technology has.\" But he says Mei has \"guardrails\" built into the AI. \"We welcome professionals and organisations to partner with us and take an active role in molding our AI products,\" he says. OpenAI the creator of ChatGPT says that its latest model has shown improvements in areas like avoiding unhealthy levels of emotional reliance and sycophancy. In a statement the company said: \"People sometimes turn to ChatGPT in sensitive moments, so we want to make sure it responds appropriately, guided by experts.  This includes directing people to professional help when appropriate, strengthening our safeguards in how our models respond to sensitive requests and nudging for breaks during long sessions.\" Another area of concern is privacy. Such apps could potentially collect very sensitive data, which could be devastating if exposed by hackers. Mr Lee says \"at every fork in the road on how we handle user privacy, we choose the one that preserves privacy and collects only what we need to provide the best service.\" As part of that policy, he says that Mei does not ask for information that would identify an individual, other than an email address. Mr Lee also says conversations are saved temporarily for quality assurance but discarded after 30 days. \"They are not currently saved permanently to any database.\" Some people are using AI in combination with a human therapist. When Corinne (not her real name) was looking to end a relationship late last year, she started to turn to ChatGPT for advice on how to deal with it. London-based Corinne says she was inspired to turn to AI after hearing her housemate talk positively about using it for dating advice, including how to break up with someone. She said she would ask it to respond to her questions in the same style as popular relationship expert Jillian Turecki or holistic psychologist Dr Nicole LePera, both very popular on social media. When she started dating again at the start of the year she turned to it again, again asking for advice in the style of her favourite relationship experts. \"Around January I had been on a date with a guy and I didn't find him physically attractive but we get on really well so I asked it if it was worth going on another date. I knew they would say yes as I read their books but it was nice to have the advice tailored to my scenario.\" Corinne, who has a therapist, says the discussions with her therapist delve more into childhood than the questions she raises with ChatGPT over dating or relationship queries. She says that she treats AI advice with \"a bit of distance\". \"I can imagine people ending relationships and perhaps having conversations they shouldn't be having yet [with their partner] as ChatGPT just repeats back what it thinks you want to hear. \"It's good in life's stressful moments. And when a friend isn't around. It calms me down.\""}

Pressure was building from Trump's own supporters and from voices within his own Republican Party for more transparency on what the federal investigations into Epstein uncovered. After weeks of resisting release, Trump reversed course and urged Republicans to vote to open the Epstein files to public scrutiny. Both chambers of Congress - the legislative branch of US government - on Tuesday agreed to approve a measure that compels the US justice department to release all files pertaining to its investigation into Epstein. The bill will make its way from the Senate to the president's desk, where he is expected to sign it into law. In 2008, Epstein reached a plea deal with prosecutors after the parents of a 14-year-old girl told police in Florida that Epstein had molested their daughter at his Palm Beach home. Photos of girls were found throughout the house, and he was convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor, for which he was registered as a sex offender. He escaped a heavy jail sentence as a result of the deal. Eleven years later, he was charged with running a network of underage girls for sex. He died in prison while awaiting trial and his death was ruled a suicide. These two criminal investigations amassed a vast trove of documents including transcripts of interviews with victims and witnesses, and items confiscated from raids on his various properties. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) found over 300 gigabytes of data and physical evidence in its databases, hard drives and other storage, according to a 2025 memo from the justice department. While some of the files likely include materials gathered by prosecutors working at federal level and Florida state level to investigate Epstein, the justice department says there is a \"large volume\" of images and videos of victims and other illegal child abuse material. These files would not be released to the public, as the latest legislation passed by Congress allows the justice department to withhold information that identifies victims. There was also a separate investigation into his British co-conspirator and ex-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 of conspiring with Epstein to traffic girls for sex. Both Epstein and Maxwell were also the subject of civil cases. At various stages over the years, some materials have been put into the public domain. Last week, thousands of documents belonging to the Epstein estate were released by the House Oversight Committee, mostly emails. That was not the first tranche released by the House Oversight Committee since it subpoenaed Epstein's estate earlier in the year. An earlier release, in September, included a birthday book containing a note to Epstein bearing Trump's name, which he has denied writing. In February, weeks after Trump took office, the Department of Justice and the FBI released what they described at the time as the \"first phase of the declassified Epstein files\". A group of right-wing influencers were invited to the White House, but they were left disappointed when they realised that the 341 pages handed to them were mostly material already out there. It included flight logs from Epstein's plane and a redacted version of his contacts book containing the names of famous people he knew. In July, the Department of Justice and FBI said in a memo that no more material would be released. The vote in the House of Representatives was forced by a discharge petition getting its critical 218th signature to trigger action on the floor. Four Republicans and all 214 Democrats in the House signed the petition. The voteto release the files took place on 18 November and the bill passed 427-to-1 in the House. Republican lawmaker Clay Higgins of Louisiana was the sole no vote. A handful of legislators did not vote. Once the bill passed in the lower chamber of Congress, it swiftly moved to the Senate where it passed via unanimous consent - a procedure that speeds up the legislative process if there is no objection. Before that, Republican senators had not said much about where they stood. After passing the Senate without objection, the bill headed to the president's desk, where Trump has said he will sign it. If Trump goes ahead, there are several hurdles to the full release of the files. Attorney General Pam Bondi will be required to release all materials and documents related to Epstein and Maxwell within 30 days of the law being enacted. But Bondi has the power to withhold any information that could jeopardise a federal investigation or identify Epstein's victims. The document that went before the House states that the attorney general could withhold or redact personal information that \"would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\". Trump has repeatedly called for an investigation into senior figures among the Democrats. Republicans have said that they fear that investigations into Epstein's links could block or delay details in the files. Representative Thomas Massie said he was concerned that a \"flurry of investigations\" could be opened as a way to avoid releasing the information. The contents of the unreleased documents remain unknown. According to The Wall Street Journal, Trump was told by Bondi in May that his name appeared in FBI documents. He used to be friends with Epstein and the paper noted that being named in the files was not evidence of wrongdoing. A White House spokesman called the story \"fake\", although an unnamed official speaking to Reuters news agency said the administration did not dispute that Trump's name had been included. Existing materials in the public domain mention a number of high-profile figures connected to Epstein. Again, this does not imply any wrongdoing by those individuals. Dozens of names came up in a release of court documents in 2024, including Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the former prince and brother of King Charles III, former US President Bill Clinton and Michael Jackson. Both Clinton and the British royal deny any knowledge of Epstein's crimes. Jackson died in 2009. The release of those documents related to the case of Maxwell, who is serving 20 years in prison for child sex trafficking. Billionaire Elon Musk and Mr Mountbatten-Windsor were named in flight logs released in September. Mr Mountbatten-Windsor has previously strenuously denied any wrongdoing. Mr Musk has been quoted as saying that Epstein invited him to the island but he declined. The latest batch of emails belonging to the Epstein estate and released on 12 November also featured Clinton's former Treasury Secretary, Larry Summers, and Trump's former aide Steve Bannon. Summers later said he would be stepping back from public commitments, writing in a statement: \"I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr Epstein.\" Mr Bannon, who is not accused of any wrongdoing, did not reply to the BBC's request for comment. Trump's name was also mentioned several times in that latest release. He has always denied any wrongdoing. Trump and Epstein appear to have been friends for a number of years, keeping a similar social circle. Previously released files show that Trump's details were in Epstein's \"black book\" of contacts. Flight logs also showed Trump flying on Epstein's plane on several occasions. They were pictured together at elite events in the 1990s, and photos published by CNN purport to show Epstein in attendance at Trump's wedding to then-wife Marla Maples. In 2002, Trump described Epstein as a \"terrific guy\". Epstein would later remark: \"I was Donald's closest friend for 10 years.\" According to Trump, they fell out in the early 2000s, two years before Epstein was first arrested. By 2008, Trump was saying that he had not been \"a fan of his\". The White House has suggested that their fallout was connected to Epstein's behaviour, and that \"the president kicked him out of his club for being a creep\". The Washington Post, meanwhile, has suggested that the breakdown in their relationship was due to their rivalry over some real estate in Florida. Die-hard members of Trump's MAGA movement have long believed officials are hiding key truths about Epstein's life and death. Some of them have theorised that a child-molesting cabal has been operating at the highest levels of US society, protected by the state. The theory spread through cryptic messages posted by a pseudonymous character called Q. In one of the conspiracy theories pushed by some MAGA influencers, Epstein was an agent of the Israeli government. Some Trump allies have tried to quell the backlash. Last month, the Republican-controlled House announced an early recess for the chamber, stalling efforts to force the release of Epstein-related documents within 30 days. There are several unanswered questions about Epstein shared by the wider population too - particularly why he was given such a lenient sentence in Florida, whether he and Maxwell were really acting alone, and how he was allowed to take his own life in prison."}

Worldwide, around $3tn (£2.2tn) will be spent on data centres that support AI between now and 2029. That estimate comes from the investment bank Morgan Stanley, which adds that roughly half of that sum will go on construction costs, and half on the pricey hardware supporting the AI revolution. To put that number into perspective, that's roughlywhat the entire French economywas worth in 2024. In the UK alone, it's estimated thatanother 100 data centreswill be built over the next few years to meet the demand for AI processing. Some of those will be built for Microsoftwhich earlier this monthannounced $30bn (£22bn) investment in the UK's AI sector. Just what is it about AI data centres that's different from the traditional building containing ranks of computer servers that keeps our personal photos, social media accounts and work applications humming away? And are they worth this terrific spending spree? Data centres have been growing in size for years. A new term, hyperscale, was coined by the tech industry to describe sites where the power requirement runs into tens of megawatts, before gigawatts, a thousand times bigger than megawatts, came on the scene. But AI has supercharged this game. Most AI models rely on expensive computer chips from Nvidia to process tasks. Nvidia chips come in large cabinets costing around $4m each. And these cabinets hold the key to why AI data centres are different. The Large Language Models (LLMs) that train up AI software have to break language into every possible tiny element of meaning. That is only possible with a network of computers working in unison and in extremely close proximity. Why is proximity so important? Every metre of distance between two chips adds a nanosecond, one billionth of a second, to the processing time. It might not sound like much time, but when a warehouse full of computers is whirring away these microscopic delays pile up and dilute the performance needed for AI. The AI processing cabinets are jammed in together to eliminate this element of latency and create what the tech sector calls parallel processing, operating as one enormous computer. It all spells out density, a magic word in AI construction circles. Density eliminates the processing bottlenecks that regular data centres see from working with processors sitting several metres apart. However, those dense ranks of cabinets eat up gigawatts of power and LLM training produces spikes in that appetite for electricity. These spikes are equivalent to thousands of homes switching kettles on and off in unison every few seconds. This type of irregular demand on a local grid needs to be carefully managed. Daniel Bizo of data centre engineering consultancy The Uptime Institute analyses data centres for a living. \"Normal data centres are a steady hum in the background compared to the demand an AI workload makes on the grid.\" Just like those synchronised kettles, sudden AI surges present what Mr Bizo calls a singular problem. \"The singular workload at this scale is unheard of,\" says Mr Bizo, \"it's such an extreme engineering challenge, it's like the Apollo programme.\" Data centre operators are getting around the energy problem in various ways. Speaking to the BBC earlier this month, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that in the UK in the short term he was hoping that more gas turbines could be used \"off the grid so we don't burden people on the grid\". He said AI itself would design better gas turbines, solar panels, wind turbines and fusion energy to produce more cost effective sustainable energy. Microsoft is investing billions of dollars in energy projects, including a deal with Constellation Energy that will seenuclear power produced againon Three Mile Island. Google, owned by Alphabet,is also investing in nuclear poweras part of a strategy to run oncarbon-free energy by 2030. Meanwhile Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is part of the retail giant Amazon, says it is alreadythe single largest corporate buyerof renewable energy in the world. The data centre industry is acutely aware that legislators are keeping an eye on the downsides of AI factories with their intense energy use having a potential impact on local infrastructure and the environment. One of these environmental impacts includes a hefty supply of water to cool toiling chips. In the US state of Virginia, home to an expanding population of data centres that keep tech giants like Amazon and Google in business, a bill tying approval of new sites to water consumption figures is under consideration. Meanwhile a proposed AI factory in northern Lincolnshire in the UK has run into objections from Anglian Water, which is responsible for keeping taps on in the area of the proposed site. Anglian Water points out that it is not obliged to supply water for non-domestic use and suggests recycled water from the final stage of effluent treatment as a coolant rather than drinking water. Given the practical problems and enormous costs AI data centres face, is the whole movement really one big bubble? One speaker at recent data centre conference coined the term \"bragawatts\" to describe how the industry is talking up the scale of proposed AI sites. Zahl Limbuwala is a data centre specialist at tech investment advisors DTCP. He acknowledges big questions around the future of AI data centre spending. \"The current trajectory is very difficult to believe. There has certainly been a lot of bragging going on. But investment has to deliver a return or the market will correct itself.\" Bearing these cautions in mind, he still believes AI merits a special place in investment terms. \"AI will have more impact than previous technologies, including the internet. So it's feasible we'll need all those gigawatts.\" He notes that bragging apart, AI data centres \"are the real estate of the tech world.\" Speculative tech bubbles such as the dotcom boom of the 1990s lacked a bricks and mortar base. AI data centres are very solid. But the spending boom behind them cannot last forever."}

The 34-year-old was dismissed after 11 minutes of the Springboks' 32-14 win over Italy last weekend, with referee James Doleman judging that there had been a high degree of danger in Mostert's tackle on fly-half Paolo Garbisi and a straight shoulder, with no attempt to \"wrap\" his arms, meant no mitigation could be applied to the incident. However, a three-person disciplinary committee determined that, although Mostert had made contact with Garbisi's head, he initially hit lower down. \"[Head contact] was found to be secondary to the initial shoulder contact and made with much lower force and without the requisite level of 'danger' required under World Rugby's Head Contact Process to make the offending reach the red card threshold,\" the committee wrote after reviewing replays and evidence from Mostert. South Africa are already missing Mostert's fellow second row Lood de Jager for the meeting with Ireland afterDe Jager was sent off for a similar incident in the Springboks' win over France a fortnight agoand banned for the rest of the autumn internationals. South Africa assistant coach Mzwandile Stick claimed onMonday that his side were being treated unfairly by officials.He also referenced bans given to Makazole Mapimpi and Jan-Hendrik Wessels for incidents on club duty that have kept them out of South Africa's northern hemisphere tour.

The 33-year-old replaces Tom Roebuck, who suffered a foot injury in last weekend's 33-19 win over New Zealand. \"He has been chomping at the bit for a few weeks,\" said head coach Steve Borthwick of Daly onRugby Union Weekly \"He has been desperate to get going. He was given the OK last week, he was available for selection, but I felt that his return to contact needed that little bit longer. \"He is good to go this week. The nature of his injury means he has been able to do plenty of running, so he looks in fantastic condition. He ran a speed time last week that was at, or very very close to, to his fastest speed ever.\" Daly's inclusion is one of six changes to the starting XV as Borthwick, whose hand is partly forced by injury, experiments with more combinations. Henry Slade is at outside centre with Ollie Lawrence ruled out with a hamstring problem. Elsewhere, there is an all-new front row with Ellis Genge and Luke Cowan-Dickie recalled alongside Asher Opoku-Fordjour, who makes only his second Test start. Ben Spencer starts at scrum-half, while Theo Dan is named on the bench with Saracens team-mate Jamie George ruled out with hamstring trouble. Marcus Smith is on the bench once more, with full-back Freddie Steward showing no signs of concussion after a head knock against the All Blacks, and fly-half George Ford, who scored 13 points last weekend, retained. England:Steward; Feyi-Waboso, Slade, Dingwall, Daly; Ford, Spencer; Genge, Cowan-Dickie, Opoku-Fordjour, Itoje, Coles, Pepper, Underhill, Earl. Replacements:Dan, Baxter, Stuart, Ewels, T Curry, Pollock, Mitchell, M Smith. England are chasing an 11th successive victory to round off a hugely encouraging 2025 in style. Argentina are aiming to complete a hat-trick of wins on their northern hemisphere tour, having thrashed Wales 52-28 and fought back to overcome Scotland 33-24 last weekend. They will have to buck historical trends to do so, having won only five of the 29 previous Test meetings. However, the Pumas were victorious on their last visit to Twickenham,edging a 2022 contest by a single point. Daly initially attempted to play through his arm injury on the Lions tour, only to be ruled out with a significant break Daly had impressed in the early stages of the Lions' tour to Australia this summer and, with Ireland rival Hugo Keenan struggling with sickness, had staked his claim as a possible starting Test full-back. However an innocuous collision with Queensland Reds' Jock Campbell in the team's second tour match, left Daly's right forearm with a fracture running the length of the bone. \"I could feel that it was all wobbly and clicking,\" hetold the Times of his short-lived attempt to play on.,external Daly required 16 screws and a metal plate to be inserted to fix the injury and, although he has yet to make his comeback for Saracens, he has been part of England's training camp this autumn. His ability to fill in at centre is a useful asset as the side continues with Marcus Smith, who covers fly-half and full-back, as the only backline specialist on the bench, while Daly's long-range goal-kicking is also a weapon. \"Watching the team grow, I just want to try and add to it as much as possible,\" said Daly. \"The performance on Saturday was outstanding and the performances over the last three games has been brilliant. \"I am raring to go and can't wait.\" Daly (left) joins in the celebrations after last weekend's win over the All Blacks BBC rugby union correspondent Chris Jones: Steve Borthwick is managing to both win matches and build depth at the moment; a perfect position for an international head coach to be in, especially halfway through a Rugby World Cup cycle. Elliot Daly's return to fitness is most welcome as it gives England another ball-playing option in the back three, while it's a big afternoon for Henry Slade, who gets a chance for the first time this month and will be keen to prove he remains a key part of the midfield picture. After an excellent six months, George Ford has now edged ahead of Fin and Marcus Smith in the fly-half pecking order, while Ben Spencer's start at scrum-half means Alex Mitchell drops to a bench which includes five British and Irish Lions.

But the elements that power and run it are the subject of an escalating struggle between the world's two biggest economies - the US and China - with African countries in the eye of the storm. The African continent is rich in critical minerals and metals - like lithium, rare earths, cobalt and tungsten  - which are vital to making and running our personal tech. Such materials are also essential for everything from electric vehicles, to AI data centres, and weapon systems. China has long been thebiggest playerin the global market for critical minerals and metals. It has significant reserves at home, and access to supplies from overseas thanks to major investment in foreign mining operations - particularly in Africa. Beijing has also built up a dominant position when it comes to processing global supplies, and it has rattled the US with the threat of curbing exports. That's lent added urgency to US moves to increase its access to critical minerals and metals, with African reserves seen as key to that mission. This is so much the case that the US has actually quietly overtaken China as the biggest foreign direct investor in Africa,according to the latest annual figures.The US invested $7.8bn (£6bn) across Africa in 2023, compared with $4bn by China, according to the China Africa Research Initiative of Johns Hopkins University, which accessed official data. It marks the first time since 2012 that the US had regained the lead. This American investment is being led by a government agency called the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC). This was set up in 2019 during President Trump's first term of office, and it is not shy about saying that its mission is to take on Beijing. The DFC says on its website that it was established as a means of\"countering China's presence in strategic regions\". What does this investment mean for African firms and countries who are beneficiaries? Last year Rwandan mining company Trinity Metalssecured a $3.9m grantfrom the DFC to help develop the three mines that it owns in the country, producing tin, tantalum and tungsten. \"The US government has been very supportive of what we've been doing, to look at bringing that supply chain directly to the United States,\" says company chairman Shawn McCormick. Trinity now sends tungsten from Rwanda to a processing plant in Pennsylvania. It has also struck a deal to send Rwandan tin to a smelter in Pennsylvania. Mr McCormick denies that the funding from Washington influenced the company's decision to send supplies to the US. \"This was not the US government who said to the CEO and I 'could you please get that tungsten to America?' It's our decision as players in the commercial market.\" Trinity is 5% owned by the Rwandan government, and Irish critical minerals investment firm TechMet is also a shareholder. Mr McCormick adds that while some mining operations in Africa can use untrained workers operating in dangerous conditions, Trinity follows the highest standards. \"We have shown that there is a way to produce these materials in a conflict free, child labour free way that is professionalised, and that's paying taxes and respecting the community and the environment, creating jobs and opportunity\". Sepo Haihambo is an economist, and former executive at banking group FNB Namibia. She says African nations must be assertive in standing up for their national interests when negotiating with US entities, and shouldn't expect any favours. \"To expect [the Americans] to show up and negotiate and propose clauses that are in Africa's best interests on Africa's behalf would be unrealistic,\" she says. \"So Africa really needs to prepare itself for these engagements and be really clear on what [outcomes] it wants.\" Ms Haihambo adds that African governments should expand away from simple cash for minerals deals. \"There's an opportunity to look at different frameworks instead,\" she says. \"You could look at production sharing agreements, joint venture models, local equity participation. Ultimately that then creates an opportunity for African countries to create, maybe, sovereign wealth funds that can then invest into developmental areas like education, healthcare etc.\" She also wants to see more processing of minerals and metals done in Africa, rather than simply exporting the ores overseas, as this would be more financially lucrative. One US company that is building a critical minerals and metals refinery in Africa is ReElement Africa, a subsidiary of US group American Resources. ReElement Africa isconstructing the refineryin South Africa's Gauteng province. \"It was extremely rewarding to realise that we could partner with countries in Africa to put refining facilities alongside the resource in the mining projects, so you could actually capture more value, upskill labour, build an economy around that zone, and lay the foundation for further industrial development,\" says Ben Kincaid, CEO of ReElement Africa. However, Prof Lee Branstetter, an international economist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, says the US has missed a trick. He argues that Trump's trade tariffs on African nations have reduced enthusiasm for the US across the continent at a time when some in sub-Saharan African nations have complained that Chinese investment is not benefiting local populations enough. \"Had the current administration not indiscriminately slapped tariffs on large numbers of African countries for no apparent reason, the United States would probably have been in a better position to benefit from African disaffection with Chinese  projects,\" says Prof Branstetter. Going forward, the US and China may also see increased competition in Africa from others, adds Ms Haihambo. She points to increased interest in the continent by countries such as Brazil, India and Japan."}

Every delegation has its interests, and negotiations at UN climate talks are all about compromise. Which is a problem Australia knows all too well as it engages in parallel negotiations of its own in Belém. For some time now, there's been a deadlock between Australia and Turkey over who will host next year's meeting – and it all needs to be ironed out by the end of next week when the talks come to a close. If no agreement between the two is reached, hosting will default to the German city of Bonn, where the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change is headquartered. Brazil would have preferred the matter be sorted out much sooner, mindful that the quiet chatter in COP corridors about the next presidency will soon become deafening, with neither side backing down. Back in 2022, Australia put together a convincing proposition of co-hosting COP31 with the Pacific. A year after focusing on rainforests in Brazil, the oceans would be in the spotlight. Rising sea levelsare a constant talking point, and Pacific islanders have the most to lose. Fiji held the presidency in 2017 but the talks themselves took place in Bonn – 2026 would be a chance for the world to see first-hand the effects of climate change. For Australia, showing commitment to its neighbours was good domestic politics. \"Having it close to your home means you can create space for the greatest ambition,\" says Shiva Gounden of Greenpeace Australia Pacific. \"The Pacific has always led in trying to come up with ambition that really addresses the climate crisis.\" But it was also good geopolitics, putting on a united front with the Pacific, a region where Chinese influence is growing. Australia's position would be strengthened, the Pacific would be put on the map. It felt like a win-win. How times change. Now, Australia's bid to co-host COP with the Pacific looks like it's faltering. And possibly failing. Australia has long maintained it has overwhelming support to host next year's summit. In fact, more than two years ago, in my conversations with diplomatic sources, there was an extremely confident prediction that this was Australia's bid to lose. It was just a question of coming to a deal with Turkey, but the belief was that that wouldn't be an insurmountable problem. Recently several options have been floated, including reportedly splitting the hosting rights with Ankara. \"There was a fair bit of complacency early on in the process,\" says Gavan McFadzean of the Australian Conservation Foundation, who is currently in Belém. \"[There was] an assumption that an Australian/Pacific joint presidential bid would just sail through.\" But Turkey is not budging on its desire to host. While that's not Australia's fault, many feel more could have been done to push Australia's credentials as a climate leader. At the COP leaders' meeting last week, several dozen leaders attended including the UK's Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron. President Erdogan of Turkey didn't show up; neither did Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. It's not a strong signal of Australia's commitment. Speaking to the ABC last week, the president of Palau, Surangel Whipps Jr, who has been one of the biggest Pacific voices when it comes to climate change, said it was \"crunch time\", arguing that Albanese's presence could hopefully \"push Turkiye over the line.\" Hosting COP was an election promise by Albanese, but it's not a universally popular political move. While the expense of bringing COP here is often cited by critics - recent reports put it at A$1bn ($650m; 500m pounds) -  supporters of hosting COP talk about the investment and tourism it will bring to Australia, especially Adelaide where it would be hosted. But there's also a lot to lose for Australia more broadly. There's been a fair bit of criticism over UN climate talks in recent years. Last year, in Azerbaijan, the president said that natural gas was \"a gift from God\". The year before that, the talks were hosted in Dubai – a city in one of the richest oil states in the world. Turkey, if it wins, has close ties with the Russia and Saudi Arabia, both countries who have frustrated past efforts to move forward on climate action. So there was a view that Australia could help turn around the COP brand. The idea being that Australia is one of the \"good ones\", committed to bringing down emissions and working multilaterally to reach UN goals. Only there's a big flaw in that argument - Australia is the largest exporter of coal in the world and one of the biggest natural gas exporters. Australia has one of the highest per capita emissions globally. While Albanese has made strong commitments to tackle climate change - his government recently committed to bringing down emissions in 2035 to between 60 and 72% of 2005 levels - his administration has also recentlyextended the North West Shelf, one of Australia's largest gas projects. It's trying to embrace the transition to renewables but knows that its loyalties - and its wealth -  lie in fossil fuel exports. The minister for climate change and energy, Chris Bowen, has been a huge champion of Australia co-hosting COP. But several sources have told me that Albanese and Foreign Minister Penny Wong have been less than enthusiastic about the prospect. Does Australia want to come under such scrutiny? Perhaps not everyone in the government will be upset if it can't pull off the bid."}

In the year to September it saw a 3.1% fall in like-for-like sales compared with the year prior, which it said reflected weak consumer confidence. The company said it expected the \"subdued\" retail market to impact Primark sales into 2026. ABF said that it was exploring splitting off the fast-fashion retailer from its food business, where it owns brands like Twinings, Ovaltine and Ryvita. The entire business saw profits fall by 13% to £1.4bn for the year. Chief executive George Weston said though he was \"confident\" for 2026, it depended on the \"consumer environment\" which was was \"particularly unpredictable at the moment\". British shoppers have been tightening their belts amid rising prices on the UK high street, and turning to even cheaper competitors such as Shein and Temu. Inflation, the rate at which prices rise, has held stubbornly at 3.8% for the year to September. Although inflation is down from highs seen in 2022-2023, it remains above the Bank of England's target of 2%. The Associated British Foods boss said in a call after the financial results that there was a \"working assumption\" in ABF that a separation of Primark \"is where we would like to get to\", although no decision had been made. Dan Coatsworth from AJ Bell said it was not clear what triggered a rethink by the board, which had previously pushed back against the idea of a break-up, but did say Primark could command a much higher share price as a standalone company separate from its food business, which AB Foods said was \"less well-understood\" by the market. Mr Coatsworth said over the years many people have expressed a desire to only invest in Primark, rather than have its rapid growth \"diluted\" by non-retail interests. He added that \"the wheels are being greased for a corporate break-up\", especially as such demergers are \"all the rage\" at present, with Unilever, Kraft Heinz and Warner Bros Discovery among those currently in the process. \"The idea of 'slimming to greatness' is based on the principle that big companies might benefit from having a tighter focus rather than spinning three or four plates at the same time,\" he added. Laura Lambie from Rathbones added that ABF was a \"disparate mixture of businesses with no real strategic rationale behind it\". Primark, which has 476 stores in 18 countries, had reached the size where it requires extra focus to capitalise on its growth prospects, particularly overseas said analysts, with one saying Primark was the \"jewel\" in ABF's crown. But Primark's challenges in the UK could worsen as Chancellor Rachel Reeves is widely expected to raise taxes in the Budget later this month. That would come on top of cost rises seen since the last Budget, including more expensive staffing costs as a result of the rise in minimum wage. People are feeling insecure about their jobs as businesses cut back on hiring, said Laura Lambie from Federated Hermes, and that was part of what was fuelling a \"difficult environment\" for retailers as profit margins shrunk. The news comes as a series of casualties on the UK high street continue as the costs of maintaining bricks-and-mortar stores becomes too high amidst rising online competition and  pressure on consumer spending. Recent retail names that have had to close stores or enter administration includeBodycare,Claire's, andPizza Hutwhich said it will be slashing the number of restaurants it operates."}

Straight-sets singles wins for Matteo Berrettini and Flavio Cobolli earned victory for an Italian team which dominated despite missing the nation's top two players in Jannik Sinner and Lorenzo Musetti. Italy move on to a semi-final meeting with Belgium on Friday, after their upcoming opponentsbeat France on the opening dayof the Finals in Bologna. They will begin that match on a 12-tie winning streak at the Davis Cup Finals, stretching back to the group stages of the 2023 tournament. In the other half of the draw, Spain face the Czech Republic before Argentina play Germany on Thursday. Davis Cup organisers confirmed to BBC Sport this week that talks will take place about the tournament's future format amid the absence of several top players at this year's event. That includes Italian top-10 players Sinner and Musetti, with world number two Sinner opting to maximise his recovery during the sport's brief six-week off-season after triumphing at the ATP Finals on Sunday. But, in their place, Berrettini and Cobolli shone for their nation. Former Wimbledon runner-up Berrettini got Italy off to a positive start by defeating the 177th-ranked Jurij Rodionov 6-3 7-6 (7-4). Berrettini, the world number 56, took the opening set with a single break of serve, but faced an uphill battle in the second when he was broken for the first time and fell 5-2 behind. The 29-year-old responded admirably, withstanding three set points to level at 5-5 and maintaining that momentum to wrest control of the tie-break and avoid a decider. 'Tremendous honour' - Federer added to Hall of Fame Slam winner Salisbury to take a break over anxiety Davis Cup discussions planned with top stars \"When I play for my country I just think about trying to win the next point, trying to fight really hard for my team-mates, for everybody who is here and everyone who is watching from home,\" said Berrettini. \"That's the biggest privilege. If I win it's better, but I try to enjoy being out there every time. It is something so special.\" World number 22 Cobolli followed his compatriot with a commanding 6-1 6-3 victory over Austrian number one Filip Misolic. The 23-year-old Cobolli, who impressed with a run to the Wimbledon quarter-finals this year, dominated a first set lasting just 30 minutes with three breaks of serve. He tightened his grip on the match early in the second set, securing an early break as he moved into a 3-0 lead, before confidently serving his way to victory.

The German government said exports would resume from 24 November after it suspended sales of military equipment that could be used in the Gaza Strip in August. Germany - the second largest supplier of arms to Israel behind the US - stopped shipments after Israel approved a ground offensive to take over Gaza City. Since then, Israel and Hamas have signed the first phase of a peace deal that came into force on 10 October. Germany said the ceasefire had now \"stabilised\" and that was the basis for them to lift the suspension. A spokesperson for the German government said on Monday: \"We expect everyone to stick to the agreements that have been made. \"This means that the ceasefire holds, that humanitarian aid is provided on a large scale and that the process continues in an orderly manner as agreed.\" At the time of the initial suspension, Israel had approved a plan to capture and occupy all of Gaza City, which the UN warned would lead to \"more massive forced displacement\" and \"more killing\". The plan drew widespread condemnation from Israel's allies including Germany, a staunch supporter of the country following the Nazi Holocaust during World War Two when more than six million Jewish people were killed. Chancellor Friedrich Merz said in August that while Israel had \"the right to defend itself against Hamas' terror\", the German government was \"profoundly concerned about the continued suffering\" of people in the Gaza Strip. Between 2020 and 2024, Germany accounted for 33% of Israel's military arms imports, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. The majority of these were warships followed by torpedoes. Germany also supplies parts for engines used in Merkava tanks. A government spokesperson said that from next week, a decision on arms exports to Israel would be \"made on a case-by-case basis\". Hamas-led gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage. At least 69,483 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli military action in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Since the ceasefire came into effect, Hamas has returned 20 living hostages in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza. Hamas also returned the remains of 25 out of 28 deceased hostages."}

Think Sir Alastair Cook's player-of-the-series-winning runs in 2010-11 as England triumphed in Australia for the first time in 24 years. Or Mitchell Johnson ripping England apart three years later. Others such as Shane Warne (1993), Jofra Archer (2019), and Marnus Labuschagne (2019) have used Ashes series to announce themselves on the Test stage. England's Chris Woakes, now retired, was named player of the series in 2023. 18 months earlier, it went to Australia's Travis Head. So who will be the key player for each team this winter? We challenged the BBC Test Match Special team to think outside the box as they made their selections. Former England captain and TMS commentator Michael Vaughan:\"The obvious choice is the two captains but I'm going to throw in Josh Tonguefor England. \"At times, he didn't bowl great [this summer], but you look at the way he hoovered up the tail on a few occasions against India. I loved the fact he went back to play for Notts and blew Surrey away at The Oval. \"If you go back to the Ashes in the UK, the Test match at Lord's, you could argue he was England's best bowler. That awkward action he delivers had the likes of [David] Warner and [Usman] Khawaja in a few problems. He's brilliant bowling at left-handers and he could be that bowler you turn to when Travis Head comes to the wicket. \"For Australia, Cameron Green. He's back bowling in state cricket but his body is going to have to be carefully managed. \"He's a powerful player, a powerful batter. England are going to throw pace at Australia and he plays fast bowling well. He's got the game on the back foot, he gets that stride forward and punches it down the ground. The way he catches, he's the albatross in that cordon.\" Ben Duckett is yet to play a Test in Australia while Zak Crawley averages 27.66 in three Tests down under Former England captain Sir Alastair Cook:\"I'm highlighting the entire England batting line-up because they need at least four of them to have a good series to win the Ashes. England will take wickets, but they need runs on the board. \"It's proven in pretty much any series, especially away from home. You need one batter to have an outstanding series, then two or three to dovetail. Joe Root could score 600 runs, only for England to still lose. He'd need Harry Brook to score two of those brilliant hundreds and someone like Zak Crawley to make an impact three times in his 10 chances at the top of the order. \"Nathan Lyon is going to be so important for Australia. I know lots of people are saying spin won't play a huge role because of the conditions, but I'm yet to be sold on that. Will they really produce pitches that leave Tests ending in two-and-a-half days? I don't see it. \"I think the pitches will be flatter than we are being led to believe, so Lyon will come into the game. England want to attack, but it's so hard to attack Lyon. He missed the last three Tests of the 2023 series and Australia could have lost all three.\" England's chance is now: Perth, the Optus & Ashes Tailenders: The Big Ashes Preview All you need to know about the 2025 Ashes Former Australia fast bowler Glenn McGrath:\"For Australia, Marnus Labuschagne, Steve Smith and Travis Head need to have good series. \"If Labuschagne can go well, it will take the pressure off Smith and Head - it would allow both of those to play their natural games. \"Labuschagne was left out of the team but has been in superb form in the Sheffield Shield to win his place back. If he can have a good series, it will have a massive impact. \"I've gone on record to say I want Ben Stokes to be England's leading run-scorer, because that would mean Australia have bowled well to the rest. That's me winding up the English. \"It's the same for England as it is for Australia - Ollie Pope, Joe Root and Harry Brook are really important. There's a lot made about Root not having made a hundred in this country and I think Brook is a special player, albeit one that will have to adapt to big Australian grounds. \"If Pope and Root do well, it frees it up for Brook.\" Travis Head was the leading run-scorer during the 2021-22 Ashes Former England bowler and BBC chief cricket commentator Jonathan Agnew:\"Frankly, I can't see England winning the Ashes without Ben Stokes. \"He's a talismanic figure, a resourceful leader, but more than anything, his bowling is important. He's critical in that department. All of the bowlers, including him, do have fitness concerns. \"Stokes has to play four out of the five Tests for England to win. \"For Australia, Travis Head will be an interesting character to watch. I think England are going to bombard him and bowl with great hostility at him. And he hasn't had a great start to the Australian season. \"Obviously, Steve Smith is crucial to their batting, but I think Head is too. There's a lot of uncertainty about how Australia are going to bat and he can change the game in the course of an hour. \"England will have some serious plans for Head - he'll need to go and buy some extra padding, and he doesn't play the short ball well. But if he does get away with it and does find a way of adapting to that attack, then I think he is potentially the most dangerous batsman in the Australian side.\" Former England bowler Steven Finn:\"I think it's a big series for Brydon Carse. He had some fantastic returns in New Zealand last year with the Kookaburra ball and I think his characteristics will suit bowling in Australia, with his height and his bounce that he gets from that awkward angle. \"I think you need to have a big heart to have success as a bowler in Australia. I think that seeing him charge in at the end of the day's play in Pakistan and the Test matches I've watched him play, it's been really admirable. Carse is going to be a big player for England. \"For Australia, it's Marnus Labuschagne. If he can continue his domestic form into this Ashes series, then he can put the last year or so behind him and go on to become a crucial and important player for Australia. \"If he has a good series at number three for Australia, it means a lot of the rhetoric about them having an unsettled top three coming into this series will be behind them and it could prove very difficult for England to break that middle order if he scores runs upfront. Former England spinner and TMS commentator Alex Hartley:\"Joe Root is a jet. He's England's most consistent run-scorer and holds the batting together. \"For Australia, it's got to be Nathan Lyon. He will tie up one end and England are missing a spinner with that much consistency.\" Wicketkeepers Alex Carey and Jamie Smith both have crucial roles in the middle order BBC Sport chief cricket reporter Stephan Shemilt:\"It's a big series for Jamie Smith, one of the players brought into the England side in 2024 with this Ashes series in mind. \"The Surrey man has looked every inch the Test cricketer: thrilling with the bat and more than tidy with the gloves. However, at the end of the India series - his first five-Test series behind the stumps - he started to tire and his returns in both areas diminished. Now he has to do it again. \"Australian pitches should suit his batting and it is a great place to keep. Smith just has to stay the course. An away Ashes is physically and mentally demanding. England need him going strong all the way to Sydney. \"Not that I only want to pick wicketkeepers, but I'm interested to see how Alex Carey goes. He was clearly affected by the fallout of the Jonny Bairstow stumping in 2023 and his performances faded as a result. \"Carey is particularly important ifPat Cummins' absenceis prolonged. With Cummins at eight, Australia's lower-order is decent. Without him the tail looks long so Carey will have the job of marshalling the tail-enders. \"Think how often Brad Haddin scored runs in 2013-14. The gloveman was an unsung hero because of Mitchell Johnson's destruction. This series should be nowhere near as one-sided, so all contributions will be vital.\" The final frontier: Why has Root never made a century down under? Trescothick hints Pope will be retained at three 'Australia not a bunch of old-timers - they're an outstanding team' Former England spinner and TMS commentator Phil Tufnell:\"Gus Atkinson might have gone under the radar a little in the build-up, but I think he could be vital. \"Everyone's talking about pace and bounce but you're going to need someone to hit the top of off-stump on these apparently greener pitches. And let's not forget, he also gives it more than a good go with the bat. \"For Australia, Marnus Labuschagne has come back into a bit of form and, if selected, he could be a key anchor role with the bat. \"If England can keep him quiet, it will get them into the middle order quickly. But, if he can stick around, it sets things up for the dangerous power from the likes of Head, Carey, and Beau Webster.\" Gus Atkinson has 63 wickets and a century from his 13 Test caps but is untested in Australia TMS commentator Simon Mann:\"For England, it's Gus Atkinson. If Steve Smith is right about the pitches andEngland have focused too much on out-and-out pace, then Atkinson could be the England bowler most suited to modern Australian conditions. \"As for Australia, England will under serious pressure if Scott Boland continues his excellent home form. I'm fascinated to see how England play him.\" TMS commentator Dan Norcross:\"The captain, Ben Stokes, when fit, balances England's attack and allows them both to play a spinner and whip him out of the attack if he takes tap. His experience of Australian pitches (unlike Root, he's scored a hundred there before) could be invaluable if Australia make heavy inroads with the new ball. \"He hasn't managed to stay fit through an entire series for some time (notably missing the deciding Test against India at The Oval). His ability to make it through the series could be the difference between an historic victory or another down under disaster. \"In the absence of Pat Cummins, at least initially, Josh Hazlewood, is the leader of the Australian attack. His height and metronomic accuracy could cause huge problems to England's openers and is perfectly matched to take out Root - a key lynchpin of England's top order.\" TMS commentator Henry Moeran:\"If - and it's a big if - he can stay fit and be the bowler we've seen at times since his comeback, Jofra Archer could be the difference maker. \"We've been longing to see what he can do on Australian pitches and this could be special. \"For Australia, Steve Smith. Fresh off a hundred in domestic cricket, we know he's still a phenomenal talent. Captaincy in the first Test in the absence of Pat Cummins might help him into the series, and I just think he has a crucial role to play.\" Get cricket news sent straight to your phone"}

Hosted by TV presenter AJ Odudu at Magazine London, awards were handed out in  12 categories including fashion, travel, food and education. And taking home the coveted prize of creator of the year was Max Klymenko, who is best known for his career ladder series, which he says is the most popular non-animated show in the world. In case you've not seen it, Max sets up his stepladder in various public spaces and invites passers-by to join him standing on the ladder while he tries to guess their career with a series of yes/no questions. Max came to the UK from Ukraine 14 years ago and said the reason he started creating content was because he found it impossible to get a job to get his own career going. \"I had a lot of anxiety and stress around finding a job so I created videos helping people know what jobs were available to them.\" Gold ladder in hand, Max, who has 8.5 million followers on TikTok, dedicated his award to his grandma in Ukraine who \"has no electricity to follow along\". \"I'm calling her right after this,\" he said, explaining that she used to log-in from different TikTok accounts when he first started creating content so it looked like he had more views. The 29-year-old, who accepted his award from last year's winner Kyra-Mae Turner added that he was grateful his content was being recognised because \"everything you see when you scroll on the toilet or in bed takes hours to make\". The nominees have a combined follower count of more than 83 million and the winners were voted for by five million people on the app. Winning the award for video of the year was Bemi Orojuogun, better known as bus aunty. Often seen smiling silently on TikToks as she stands at the side of a road or a depot – while a passing double-decker appears to narrowly miss hitting her – Bemi has turned her lifelong love of the London's transport network into a viral celebration of city life. Her winning video has been viewed almost 50 million times and she now has collaborations with Burberry and Ikea. The mental health nurse has become one of TikTok's most unexpected success stories and she admitted: \"It's slightly overwhelming that everyone recognises me,\" but said she is proud of what she's achieved. She thanked Transport for London and Stormzy, saying that he propelled her to fame after re-posting one of her videos. The 56-year-old grandma had a wonderful night making friends - including Nikki Lilly, the winner of the fashion and beauty creator of the year. Nikki, who has 10 million TikTok followers, told the BBC that fashion, beauty and lifestyle content can be seen as \"skin deep\" but her content challenges those perceptions. \"I don't want to only make my social media a highlights reel,\" the 21-year-old said. \"It's also me having surgeries, a chronic illness and me having a facial difference.\" After being diagnosed with an arteriovenous malformation, a rare life-threatening medical condition, at age six, she has used her platform to raise awareness and inspire others. \"As someone with a facial condition, I've never felt fully embraced in this space,\" she said while accepting her award. But she added, she has now found \"so much safety\" in the TikTok beauty world. Another advocate creator is Tola and Kevin who won the \"voice for change\" award. Tola and Kevin are a mother-son duo behind an account that posts candid videos of what it's like to raise a young adult with autism, striving to create content that raises awareness and promotes acceptance. In tears, Tola said she was so grateful for the award and explained she started the account because she felt isolated when her son was first diagnosed with autism 16 years ago. She's since built an \"amazing community who love and support Kevin\" which has helped the both of them immensely. One of the most recognisable winners of the night was Charley Marlowe, a Radio 1 presenter, who won entertainment creator of the year. If you don't know her, you're likely to know her famous cackle which has become her trademark. On the red carpet earlier in the night she told me \"Win or lose, we're on the booze, so I'm having a good night anyway.\" She was in shock to have won the award and dedicated it to \"every northern, working-class diva.\" In the bar at the awards, she would have found Phil Carr, who promised to hit the bar immediately after picking up the award for travel creator of the year. His videos show him visiting attractions and towns and cities around the UK (and occasionally further afield) where he uncovers their worst and best qualities and routinely updates viewers on how many branches of Aldi, Iceland and Wetherspoons can be found in the vicinity. He had promised his 1.1m followers he will carry out a series of forfeits suggested by them so has now lined up nights out in Luton, Clacton and a full 16 hours (from breakfast right through to last orders) in the Sweyn Forkbeard pub in Gainsborough. Lincolnshire – which he has said may be his toughest TikTok assignment to date.

Unauthorised miners forced their way into the southern Kalando mine on Saturday despite being banned from the site, said local official Roy Kaumba Mayonde. Military personnel guarding the site then reportedly fired guns, causing the bridge to collapse after panicked miners rushed across it, government mining agency SAEMAPE said. The military has not responded to this allegation. Such accidents are not uncommon in DR Congo, where around 1.5 to 2 million people work in the unregulated artisanal mining industry, which feeds the global demand for copper, cobalt and other minerals. Two of the miners injured at Kalando mine, located in the village of Mulondo, sustained bullet wounds, Olivier Kayumba, a journalist who visited the scene on Sunday, said. Mr Kayumba told the BBC that one miner had been shot in the thigh and the other in the hand. In his statement, Mayonde said no miners had died from gunshot wounds. However, he did not say whether bullets had caused any non-fatal injuries. Mayonde called the collapse at the mine \"tragic\", adding that mining companies in DR Congo were \"frequently victims of this type of invasion of their concessions by illegal miners\". The miners had erected the bridge themselves, and the unstable structure was unable to sustain a large number of people making a \"hasty\" crossing, Mayonde said. Images circulating on social media, which have not been verified by the BBC, appear to show the lifeless remains of the miners as locals look on in disbelief. In a statement, Congolese authorities urged artisanal miners to take up the government's offer of alternative training in agribusiness, in an attempt to avoid the recurrence of such tragedies. DR Congo is the world's largest supplier of cobalt, which has defence and aerospace applications as well as being essential for batteries in electric vehicles. The process of extracting cobalt in DR Congo has been beset with concerns of child labour, human rights abuses and corruption.

In response, a Chinese diplomat made a comment which some interpreted as a threat to behead Takaichi. But what began as a war of words has now gone beyond barbs:  Both countries' foreign ministries have since lodged serious protests with each other. Japan has also warned its citizens to stay safe in China, while China urged its citizens to avoid travelling to Japan. Some Chinese airlines have even offered refunds for flights to Japan. The release of two popular Japanese films in China have also been postponed. The spat touches on the historical animosity between China and Japan, as well as longstanding \"strategic ambiguity\" on the sovereignty of self-governed Taiwan. Here's what you need to know about it: The current tensions were sparked at a parliamentary meeting in Japan on 7 November, when an opposition lawmaker asked Takaichi what circumstances surrounding Taiwan would count as a survival-threatening situation for Japan. \"If there are battleships and the use of force, no matter how you think about it, it could constitute a survival-threatening situation,\" Takaichi responded. A \"survival-threatening situation\" is a legal term under Japan's 2015 security law, referring to when an armed attack on its allies poses an existential threat to Japan. In such a situation, Japan's self-defence forces can be activated to respond to the threat. Takaichi's remarks drew immediate ire from Beijing, with China's foreign ministry describing them as \"egregious\". The following day, Xue Jian, China's consul general in the Japanese city of Osaka, reshared a news article about Takaichi's parliamentary remarks on X. But he also added his own comment that \"the dirty head that sticks itself in must be cut off\". While the intent of Xue's remarks \"may not be clear\", they were \"highly inappropriate\",said Japan's chief cabinet secretary Minoru Kihara. Tokyo lodged protests with China over Xue's remarks, while Beijing lodged its own with Japan over Takaichi's. Xue's post has since been taken down - but the dust from the barbed exchanges hasn't settled yet. Takaichi hasdeclined to retract her remarks, which she defended as \"consistent with the government's traditional position\". She did note, however, that she would be careful about commenting on specific scenarios from now on. Meanwhile, China has turned up the heat on Japan, summoning the Japanese ambassador and repeatedly demanding that Takaichi takes back her words. On social media, China's foreign ministry warned Japan to \"stop playing with fire\" and added that it would be an \"act of aggression\" if Japan \"dares to meddles in the cross-Strait situation\". China has urged its citizens \"to avoid travelling to Japan in the near future\" over what it called \"blatantly provocative remarks regarding Taiwan\". This could deal a blow to Japan's tourism industry, which is supported by millions of Chinese visitors every year. Japan's tourism and retail stocks haveslid amid the row. For their part, Japanese authorities say their position of supporting \"peaceful resolution\" to issues on Taiwan \"has not changed\". They have also urged China to \"take appropriate action\" over Xue's social media post. This week, the releases of at leasttwo Japanese movies in China were also postponed, with distributors citing \"sentiments of the domestic audience\", Chinese state media reported. Chinese state media CCTV added that cinema ticket sales for the hit Japanese animation Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle had also fallen recently. There is longstanding animosity between the two countries, which can be traced back to a series of armed conflicts in the 1800s and Japan's brutal military campaign in China during World War Two. This was brought up by a Chinese defence official last week, who said Japan would face \"crushing defeat\" by the Chinese military if it \"failed to draw lessons from history and dared to take reckless risks\". Historical grievances may have long been sore spots in bilateral relations, but the recent ascension of Takaichi, a protégé of the late former prime minister Shinzo Abe,suggests more tensions may lie ahead. The conservative leader is pursuing closer ties with the US and has pledged to increase Japan's defence spending - raising some alarm in Beijing. Takaichi is also famously hawkish on China and a longtime supporter of Taiwan. She had previously said that a blockade of the island could threaten Japan, and that Japan could mobilise its troops to stop a Chinese invasion. China is especially touchy about Taiwan, the self-governed island that Beijing claims as part of its territory. China has not ruled out the use of force to take Taiwan - a posture that has unsettled Taipei and its allies in the region. Earlier this month, Beijing accused Takaichi of violating the one-China principle, after she posted photos of herself meeting a senior Taiwanese official on the sidelines of the Apec summit in South Korea. The Japanese prime minister's recent comments mark a departure from the equivocal position that the country has traditionally adopted on the status of Taiwan. This is in line with the policy of \"strategic ambiguity\" that the US has long maintained: remaining vague about what it would do to defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion. For decades, this ambiguity has kept China guessing - a form of deterrence - while leaving room for economic ties to flourish. The Japanese government's official stance is that it hopes the Taiwan issue can be resolved peacefully through dialogue - and Japanese officials have typically avoided mentioning Taiwan in public discussions about security. On the occasions where they have, they have been met with sharp rebuke from Beijing. In 2021, when then deputy prime minister Taro Aso said that Japan would need to defend Taiwan alongside the US in the event of an invasion, Beijing condemned his remarks and told Japan to \"correct its mistakes\". In this more recent flare-up, China's foreign ministry said that Takaichi's remarks were \"a gross interference in China's internal affairs\". \"Taiwan is China's Taiwan,\" ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told a press briefing on Monday, adding that China would not \"tolerate any foreign interference\" on the matter. \"What signal is the Japanese leader trying to send to 'Taiwan independence' separatist forces?\" he added. \"Is Japan up to challenge China's core interests and stop its reunification?\""}

The Haguetook action in Septemberover \"serious governance shortcomings\" and concerns over the European supply of semiconductors for cars and other electronic goods. In response, Beijing blocked exports of the firm's chips. However, on Wednesday the Dutch government said it would halt its original decision following \"constructive talks\" with Beijing. China said it welcomed the move, adding it was a \"first step in the right direction towards a proper resolution\". Nexperia is a major supplier of basic computer chips to the car industry, and shortages have threatened global supply chains. A shortage of computer chips used in various electronic goods and cars would hugely impact the ability of manufacturers to make their products. The decision by the Dutch government will ease tensions between the European Union and China, which have been mounting in recent months over trade and Beijing's relationship with Russia. Vincent Karremans, economic affairs minister, said that he considered it right to suspend action, made under the Goods Availability Act, ahead of further talks with the Chinese government. \"We are positive about the measures already taken by the Chinese authorities to ensure the supply of chips to Europe and the rest of the world,\" he said in a statement. The Dutch government said it originally invoked the Act following concerns \"from actions attributed to the now-suspended CEO, involving the improper transfer of product assets, funds, technology, and knowledge to a foreign entity\". \"These actions ran counter to the interests of the company, its shareholders, and Dutch and European strategic autonomy and security of supply,\" it said. In October, a Dutch court ordered the removal of ex-Nexperia CEO and Wingtech founder Zhang Xuezheng, citing alleged mismanagement. The Dutch government added that its decision had aimed to prevent a situation in which chips could become unavailable in an emergency. In December last year, the US government placed Wingtech, which owns Nexperia, on its so-called \"entity list\", identifying the company as a national security concern. Under the regulations, US companies are barred from exporting American-made goods to businesses on the list unless they have special approval. In the UK, Nexperia was forced to sell its silicon chip plant in Newport after MPs and ministers expressed national security concerns. It currently owns a UK facility in Stockport. Following the Dutch government's reversal, the Beijing acknowledged the move but said it was \"still a step away from addressing the root cause of the global semiconductor supply chain turmoil and chaos\". \"Furthermore, the erroneous ruling by the corporate court, spearheaded by the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, to strip Wingtech of its control over Nexperia remains a key obstacle to resolving the issue,\" it added. Wingtech has said it will fight the decision. Following the latest move, a spokesperson for Wingtch said the company \"strongly\" rejected the allegations against its chief executive. \"To date, no proof has been provided,\" it added. \"If the Dutch government is sincere about solving the problem, the Ministry should now file a letter with the Enterprise Chamber, explicitly withdrawing its support for the proceedings. \"These proceedings form a threat to the continuity of Nexperia B.V. and therefore for the economic security of the Netherlands and Europe - which is the exact same argument the Dutch government made previously in support of judicial intervention.\""}

During the government shutdown that started in October, there was a rise in absences of air traffic controllers, who - as essential employees - were required to work without pay, which led airports to delay or ground flights. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) then ordered airlines from 7 November to cut scheduled takeoffs in order to prevent safety issues. Since the shutdown ended last week, staffing levels \"have continued to snap back\", the department said, just in time for busy Thanksgiving travel. More than 6 million people in the US are expected to fly during the Thanksgiving holiday - about 2% more than last year - according to the major travel group AAA, which notes that the period is the single busiest holiday for travel in the US. \"Controllers have returned to their posts and normal operations can resume,\" said Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy as he announced that the emergency order had been lifted. \"Now we can refocus our efforts on surging controller hiring and building the brand new, state of the art air traffic control system the American people deserve.\" Air traffic controller absences were some of the most visible ramifications of the 43-day shutdown, the longest in US history. Many controllers said they were forced to take second jobs in order to make up for missing paycheques, and many of those who came to work said they experienced stress and exhaustion. Airports scrambled to keep flights on time, sometimes relying on control towers miles away to guide planes in.  The problem was made worse by an already existing shortage of controllers. The emergency order had called for up to 10% of US domestic flights to be cut, and in the first week of November thousands of flights were cancelled and even more delayed. According to the announcement ending the order, the FAA is \"aware of reports of non-compliance by carriers over the course of the emergency order. The agency is reviewing and assessing enforcement options\". It did no elaborate on which airlines allegedly did not cut flights, and how they might be penalised. Across last Saturday and Sunday, there were only nine alerts put out by airports for grounded, scrapped or late flights due to staffing shortages - a stark contrast to the previous Saturday, 8 November, when those alerts reached a record high of 81, according to the transportation department. With the end of the shutdown, controllers are set to receive back pay, and no longer face threats from Duffy of being fired for absences."}

The delayed releases include Cells at Work! and Crayon Shin-chan the Movie: Super Hot! The Spicy Kasukabe Dancers, according to Chinese state media CCTV. Cinema tickets are still available for the hit Japanese animation Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle, the BBC has confirmed, but CCTV said sales in China had fallen recently as the row deepened. Takaichi, who has been a vocal critic of China and its activities in the region, suggested earlier this month that Tokyo could take military action if Beijing attacked Taiwan. Beijing views Taiwan - to which the government overthrown by China's communist revolution fled - as a breakaway province that must be reunited with the mainland. Film distributors and importers have decided to postpone the releases after reassessing the overall outlook of Japanese films in China and the sentiment among Chinese audiences,CCTV reported on Monday. Crayon Shin-chan the Movie: Super Hot! The Spicy Kasukabe Dancers, which is an animated comedy about the adventures of a young boy and his friends, was due to be released in the coming weeks. Cells at Work! - which has also seen its release postponed - is a live action movie based on a manga about human blood cells fighting off viruses. CCTV did not say how long the films' releases will be delayed for. The state-controlled media outlet said Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle had faced \"strong dissatisfaction among Chinese audiences\" following Takaichi's remarks. The BBC has contacted the films' distributors, including Japanese media giant Toho. Takaichi told the Japanese parliament on 7 November: \"If there are battleships and the use of force, no matter how you think about it, it could constitute a survival-threatening situation.\" Beijing has since urged its citizens to avoid travel to Japan and told students to reconsider studying there, citing safety risks. Japanese tourism, airline and retail stocks fell sharplyas investors weighed the impact of the China's response. China is a key source of tourism to Japan, with almost 7.5m visitors in the first nine months of this year. Beijingbelieves that, in time, Taiwan will be returned to Chinese control. It has not ruled out the use of force to achieve this goal. But many Taiwanese consider themselves to be part of a separate nation - although most are in support of keeping the status quo in which Taiwan neither declares independence from China nor unites with it."}

It is another sign that efforts to fight climate change by cutting emissions are moving far too slowly to meet international targets, as countries meet in Brazil for UN climate talks COP30. But emissions have grown much less quickly over the past decade as renewables have taken off, providing hope that the world's warming trend can still be curbed. And separate analysis by clean energy think tank Ember suggests that fossil fuel use in electricity generation has flatlined in 2025, largely thanks to the rapid growth of solar power. It adds weight to the idea that global emissions may be nearing a peak – even though it's hard to say exactly when that might come. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions for 2025 are of course an estimate, with the year not yet complete – but they show a mixed picture. Emissions from fossil fuels and cement are forecast to increase yet again to 38.1bn tonnes of CO2, according to the Global Carbon Budget team, which comprises more than 130 scientists from 21 countries. Emissions from changing land-use – such as permanent deforestation – are forecast to be lower than last year, however. That's largely due to the end of thenatural El Niño weather pattern- which can drive higher forest losses – but is the continuation of a longer-term trend. It means that, altogether, total emissions from all human activities are expected to reach 42.2bn tonnes CO2 in 2025 - down from the 42.4bn in 2024, albeit marginally. What is clearer, the team say, is that emissions have grown more slowly over the past decade - 0.3% per year - compared to the previous decade's 1.9% per year. And over the past 10 years, 35 countries significantly cut their fossil fuel emissions while also growing their economies, they say. That is nearly double the number in the decade before. \"We're not yet in a situation where the emissions go down [as] rapidly as they need to, to tackle climate change, but at the same time there are a lot of positive [developments]\" said Corinne Le Quéré, professor of climate change science at the University of East Anglia. Emissions have been growing much less rapidly than before \"because of that extraordinary growth in renewable energy in China and elsewhere\", she added. This effect of the renewables boom is highlighted by emissions in the power or electricity sector. Electricity generated from fossil fuels is forecast to flatline or even decline slightly this year, according to the think tank Ember, for the first time since the Covid-19 pandemic. What's unusual about this year, Ember says, is that this has happened even though electricity demand increased sharply, rather than resulting from an economic recession. And this year's extra electricity demand has been more than met by wind and, particularly, solar. \"We've had decades and centuries where fossil fuels were the only way that we could really grow our economy, and over the last decade, that's changed for the first time,\" said Nicolas Fulghum, senior data analyst at Ember. \"Solar power is growing at a record pace, and faster than any electricity source in history,\" he added. What happens in the power sector is particularly important in the fight against climate change. It is the single biggest emitting sector and is expected to play an increasing role in the energy system as more people buy electric cars, heat pumps and other technologies. \"Whatever happens in the power sector has an outsized influence on what happens for emissions worldwide,\" said Mr Fulghum. Ember is confident that emissions from using fossil fuels to generate electricity are now plateauing and could begin a permanent decline in a few years. That echoes yesterday's message from the International Energy Agency, the global energy watchdog. Carbon emissions from energy systems – more than just electricity - could peak within the next few years, based on countries' stated policies, it said. While there is still uncertainty about the exact timing of a peak, it would undoubtedly be a landmark moment in the fight against climate change. It would not halt warming, however, as countries would still be adding CO2 to the atmosphere - just at a slower rate. \"As long as we emit CO2, the warming will continue… to stop further warming, we have to bring [net] emissions to zero,\" said Prof Pierre Friedlingstein, chair in mathematical modelling of climate systems at the University of Exeter. And another analysis released today to coincide with COP30 offers a reality check. The Climate Action Tracker research group finds that warming could reach 2.6C above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century based on current policies – a figure which has barely changed over the past few years. \"It's very clear that we have never had a better chance to do this. It's also clear that we've never been in a worse situation,\" said Dr Bill Hare, from the Climate Action Tracker team. \"So it's a diabolical dilemma. Things could go really badly. We could walk away from this COP without taking the right kind of action, and entrenching fossil gas and oil, and we'll push towards 2.5C [or] 3C warming for sure,\" he added. \"But on the other hand, the chance is there… to do exactly the opposite, and to build on the momentum of the technology changes going on globally.\" Sign up for our Future Earth newsletterto keep up with the latest climate and environment stories with the BBC's Justin Rowlatt.

For all of the challenges, trials and tribulations that come with playing international cricket in other parts of the world, nothing compares to the furore and pressure that accompanies travelling across the world to play an Ashes series down under. I've experienced both edges of the sword: the triumph and joy of winning the 2010-11 series, sitting among the old wooden lockers of the Sydney Cricket Ground dressing room in swathes of cigar smoke with music blaring loud long into the night in celebration. It was a stark contrast three years later, at the end of the 2013-14 series, when you could have heard a pin drop in the very same dressing room. Everyone's eyes were trained on the floor in sombre reflection after Mitchell Johnson and Australia had their way with us for two months. For all of the flashpoints and battles on the field, the challenges of the tour begin before you have even got on the plane. For months, sometimes years, eyes and minds are looking forward to the next away Ashes series. A tour of Australia gives a group of England players the opportunity to achieve cricketing immortality, or crash and burn. This isn't lost on those in the dressing room. Players will not be able to look at their phones without seeing some sort of Ashes build-up content. In 2010, I was 21 years old and so naive as to what I was stepping in to. It was both my first taste of Ashes cricket and my first tour down under. The naivety served me well as I went into the tour with my eyes so wide open it was impossible not to enjoy the excitement that came with fulfilling a boyhood dream so early in my career. Finding this state of mind is an important first step towards making a success of the tour. I kept diaries throughout my Ashes tours and my entry from the night before the first Test of 2010 was about not being able to sleep before the prospect of the best day of my life the following day, a mindset I chased for the remainder of my career with varying success. 5 Live’s Rick Edwards and Rachel Burden sledged by Finn, Hartley and others How does a modern player insulate themselves from the scrutiny that comes with this series? This team will more than likely go to a golf course, put their phone away and immerse themselves in chasing a scratch handicap for four hours. For all the bad press they get for enjoying playing golf on tour, the thought process behind it has solid logic. On the 2013 tour I didn't allow myself to escape. I practised harder and harder, pushed myself to the physical limit, believing this was the only way to find my rhythm and form. I left the tour with my brain so scrambled that I was deemed unselectable. Balance is important. Australia is an amazing country with so much to do away from a cricket ground. Embracing this and enjoying time down under lends perspective. From the moment you step off the plane, you realise it is not just you versus the Australia cricket team, but you against a vast majority of the country. Customs officials don't smile and insist on seeing your cricket spikes to make sure you are not bringing in any unwanted soil. You have to unpack your cricket bag on your hands and knees in the arrivals hall, digging around for your comfy bowling spikes you used in the English summer. If there's any dirt on them at all, you have to clean them. Welcome to Australia. I once got questioned why I had a Terry's Chocolate Orange, and whether it contained real fruit. I didn't realise they hadn't made their way down to Australia yet. Once the boots are clean and customs is cleared, you enter the arrivals hall to be greeted by news crews, asking if you're going to enjoy getting hammered by Australia for three months. Being able to smile and offer a degree of humour can soften the perception of you. There were times where we would put on our headphones and ignore the cameras, a surefire way to be called 'arrogant Poms'. In reality, who wants to speak to anyone when you've just stepped off a 24-hour flight? More than anything, the aim is to earn the respect of the Australian public and that is done through performances on the field. In that first Test of 2010 we conceded a first-innings deficit of 211 runs. 35,000 Australians were stamping their feet in the vast concrete stadium baying for English blood in a procession toward another Australian win. Alastair Cook, Andrew Strauss and Jonathan Trott famously pushed back against the noise to amass 517-1 in our second innings. The Test was drawn, but it felt like we had won. You could feel the rhetoric towards us change. The people who had taken great joy in telling us we were going to be annihilated were slowly starting to say how they respected the way we had fought back and that they loved seeing the competition. Planning is important, but so is living in the moment. Too many times England teams have gone to Australia with pre-conceived ideas about the conditions they are going to face. Being able to read the conditions and adapt is crucial. At the Melbourne Cricket Ground in 2010, David Saker, the England bowling coach, had absolute conviction bowling first was the way to win the Test. We bowled Australia out for 98 and won by an innings. Being bold with decision-making will serve England well. Finally, luck is also a huge part of being successful in Australia. In 2010 Australia didn't have a set spinner, there were question marks around the great Ricky Ponting coming towards the end of his career and uncertainty about the seam bowlers. Australia picked a 17-man squad for the first Test, more players than we had for the entire three-month tour to the country. Catching Australia in a period of transition can be critical. On this occasion, injuries to Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood have given England an opportunity to face an Australia team with the cracks maybe just starting to show for the first time since 2010. There are many challenges that come with playing in an away Ashes series, on and off the field. The stars may just be aligning for England to have a real crack at winning in Australia for the first time in 15 years. 21 November 2025 - 7 January 2026 In-play clips and highlights on iPlayer, BBC Sport website and app. Ball-by-ball commentary on BBC Sounds, BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and the BBC Sport website and app, which will also have live text commentary and daily features and analysis The rise, fall and rise again of Steven Finn 'It felt like God's hand on my brain' - the day England were humbled by teenager Get cricket news sent straight to your phone"}

The allegations reportedly stem from 2020 and involve a music producer who was asked to attend a photo shoot inside a Los Angeles warehouse where Combs allegedly assaulted him. Combs, who is serving a four-year prison sentence in New Jersey for prostitution related charges, has denied this and all allegations of sexual abuse. \"Let me make it absolutely clear, Mr. Combs categorically denies as false and defamatory all claims that he sexually abused anyone,\" one of Combs' attorneys Jonathan Davis said in a statement to the BBC. \"He looks forward to vindicating himself in court, where such matters are decided—and not in the media—based on admissible, material evidence, not rank speculation and unsubstantiated allegations,\" Mr Davis continued. The sheriff's department confirmed to the BBC that its special victim's bureau is in the preliminary stages of investigating a sexual battery allegation against Combs. It said that additional details would not be released \"given the sensitivity of the case\". The male music producer accuses Combs exposing himself and masturbating while at the warehouse photoshoot, according to US media. Combs is accused of asking him to assist in the sexual acts and throwing a dirty shirt when the producer refused, multiple news agencies report. Dozens of people- including underage accusers - have filed civil lawsuits against Combs on allegations that include being drugged and sexually assaulted. Some claims include that the music mogul made both promises of career advancement or threats if accusers spoke up. Earlier this year, the rapper was convicted in a New York trial on two counts of transportation for prostitution. He was sentenced last month to 50 months in sentence. The high-profile criminal case accused Combs of running a sprawling sex-trafficking operation and his trial included testimony from stars that includedrapper Kid Cudiand Combs' ex-girlfriendCassie Ventura. He was ultimately found not guilty of the most serious charges, which could have resulted in him spending the rest of his life in jail. \"I lost my way,\" he wrote to the judge before his sentencing. \"My downfall was rooted in my selfishness. I have been humbled and broken to my core.\" Combs is currently serving out his sentence in New Jersey."}

What happens next?", "body": "Anyone who thought the BBC's apology to Donald Trump was going to stop his threat of a lawsuit was, quite frankly, deluded. The BBC chairman Samir Shah perhapssummed it up in the interview he gave methe day after the director general and the CEO of News resigned. He called the president \"a litigious fellow\". That's an understatement, evident in the number of legal cases Trump has taken out against various US media companies. The president, based on his GB News interview, is clearly hurt by what he sees as an \"egregious\" edit, and he has now apparently upped the amount he says he will sue the corporation for. While on board Air Force One on Friday, Trump told reporters the figure would be \"anywhere between $1bn [£759m] and $5bn\". To put this in context,the BBC's annual income from the licence fee was £3.8bn last year. On Friday, Trump said: \"They changed the words coming out of my mouth.\" He wants to know why Panorama edited two clips of his speech together to give a \"totally different meaning\". He doesn't accept the BBC's responsethat what happened was unintentional. This is a very serious moment in the history of the BBC. It stands or falls by being viewed as impartial - a source to trust in a world where trust in institutions is falling. Instead, the corporation is being accused of the opposite - and faces an expensive and very public battle with the most powerful man in the world. Ever since the president first threatened legal action, it was clear that the corporation did not intend to offer him compensation. It believes it has a case that, whatever error was made, no harm was caused to Trump by the Panorama programme. He was elected president soon after it went out and anyway, says the BBC, the programme wasn't broadcast on any US channels, so how could it have harmed him? I think there was a certain consensus, inside and outside the corporation, that the notion of using licence fee payers' money to settle with Trump was a non-starter. As one former senior BBC executive put it to me, after the BBC had rejected offering compensation, \"they've made the right call\". But this person also said, if the president did decide to sue, the BBC would have to \"batten down - and get the best lawyers in Florida\". The reason to settle would have been to bring down costs in the long run. Now it looks as if the BBC will be involved in a protracted, costly court battle at a time when it should be 100% focused on the discussions over the renewal ofits charter, which are ramping up. The people at the top of the BBC should be fully concentrating on what is, in normal times, a fundamental moment for the corporation - when what it's for, its scope, how it will be funded, the details of its very existence are all hammered out between government and BBC in time for a new charter at the start of 2028. It's already losing the man who should have led that -Tim Davie, the director general. Now top BBC brains will be diverted, to game out its next moves in what could be a very damaging, even existential fight with Donald Trump. The legal fees alone could get very expensive. This might all have been avoided if the BBC had been open about the error much earlier and corrected it. Instead, it faces a long road. But there may be routes off it. Might the BBC ask the UK government to step in through back channels? Would a call from Prime Minister Keir Starmer persuade Trump to change his mind? Would Starmer even want to get involved and expend his own political capital with the US president? One positive for the BBC this weekwas the robust nature in which the culture secretary Lisa Nandy defended the corporation. She talked about the widespread trust in BBC News and described the corporation as \"a light on the hill for people in times of darkness\" which brings the country together, whether through Celebrity Traitors or its VE Day coverage. Donald Trump, on the other hand, has called the BBC \"worse than fake news\". He claims the corporation and its journalists are corrupt. The fight is well and truly on."}

It has led to a continuing huge growth in the production of military drones, both within and outside Ukraine. Before Russia's invasion of Ukraine Kseniia Kalmus was a floral artist. She co-owned a flower shop in Kyiv and travelled around Europe showcasing her floral arrangements. Now, she makes drones for use against the Russians. \"It was just an obvious decision for me,\" she tells the BBC from the Ukrainian capital. \"I just wanted to help my country, help my people and the military.\" Ms Kalmus says that after the war began back in February 2022, she raised money to buy anything the Ukrainian soldiers asked for, from vehicles to medicine and uniforms. But as time went by, the requests from the front line changed. \"I realised that all the requests were for FPV [first-person view] drones,\" she recalled. \"So I started raising money for that, specifically, and then I decided to produce them.\" These days, she and her fellow volunteers churn out hundreds of drones each month – small quadcopters with plastic X-shaped frames and a rotor blade on each corner – the kind of thing you might use to take aerial photographs at your wedding. Strap a small bomb to it though, and it becomes a deadly weapon. Combat drones, delivery drones, surveillance drones, underwater drones – drones have become a key weapon of war globally, whether it be small hand-operated quadcopters, or high-tech military drones that look like small, unmanned aeroplanes and can travel long distances and cause enormous damage on impact. Before 2022 there were just a handful of companies in Ukraine making drones. Now, there are hundreds. Kyiv says that around three-quarters of Russian losses on the battlefield are caused, not by bullets or conventional artillery, but by drones. \"This has been the first full-blown drone war,\" says Stacie Pettyjohn, director of the defence program at the Center for a New American Security in Washington, and the author of several reports on drone warfare. \"There are a ton of mom-and-pop shops in Ukraine where people are making drones and assembling them in their apartments, in their garages and donating them to the forces. They've become the go-to weapon for the Ukrainians.\" And not just the Ukrainians. Drones are increasingly being used in conflicts from the Middle East, to Myanmar and Sudan. \"You see European states talking about building drone walls and other countries seeking to acquire drones because they provide them with a cheap form of air power.\" Ms Pettyjohn says. The world's biggest defence contractors, like Lockheed Martin and Boeing, are taking note, as are smaller drone-makers like US-based AeroVironment, which is listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. Its share price hassoared more than four-foldsince Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In Europe, Portugal's Tekever became what is known as a unicorn company this year – valued at more than $1bn (£760m) – and Germany's Stark is expanding its drone-making operations. It is dueto open a new factoryin Swindon in southwest England at the end of November. Meanwhile, the UK government announced last year that it would bespending £4.5bnon new military drones. \"The sector is growing really quickly,\" said Mike Armstrong, Stark's managing director for the UK. \"I think drones are the future of warfare. Legacy systems – artillery, tanks – they all have a place, but what we've seen is a major innovation which is not going away anytime soon.\" The growth in drone use for military ends has spawned its antithesis – a counter-drone industry. For every drone launched in anger on the battlefield, there is usually someone trying to jam its radio signal or shoot it down. Anti-drone technology is also increasingly being sought by Western nations to protect key infrastructure sites. The Belgian government announced on 7 November that it was urgently trying to acquire drone defences after drone sightings forced it to temporarily close Brussels Airport. Oleg Vornik is the CEO of DroneShield, an Australian counter-drone company. \"We make hardware and software that you can carry in your hands, you can put on a vehicle or around the edge of a military base to detect and safely take down small drones,\" he says. Since 2022, DroneShield's share price hassoared 15-fold.\"We are the only public-listed counter-drone company around the world, which has helped us,\" Mr Vornik adds. As well as supplying Ukraine, Mr Vornik says DroneShield is seeing increased interest from countries in the Asian Pacific, worried about China's use of surveillance drones. DroneShield also sells to the governments of Colombia and Mexico, which use its technology to protect facilities from the use of drones by criminal gangs. Munin Dynamics is a much smaller start-up working in the same counter-drone space. Its founder is Magnus Freyer, a former paratrooper in the Norwegian army. \"We're building a system that every soldier, whether they are a newly mobilised Ukrainian or an experienced Nato soldier, can use to defend themselves from drones,\" he says. \"It's a small system that you can have a couple of in your vest, to shoot down the drone when it's coming in.\" Experts say the next big development in drone technology is likely to be driven by artificial intelligence (AI). At the moment, many drones used in conflicts are small, cheap devices that have to be guided to their targets by an operator – a human being with a remote control who needs to be within range of the drone, potentially placing them in danger. But Ms Pettyjohn says that will change. \"That is going to be the next real shift. \"Right now, really smart artificial intelligence is not very extensive. But you are going to start seeing groups of drones controlled by one operator, and then eventually fully autonomous drones that can collaborate.\" In the meantime, former floral artist Kseniia Kalmus says she will continue to assemble drones for use on the front line. \"I miss flowers very much and I miss that previous life, of course,\" she says. \"A lot of my friends, me as well, changed totally, from flower artists or from dancers to drone producers. \"But this is a question of existence. We just fight for our country, for our existence, for our culture.\""}

It has also earned the country rare rebukes from regional and continental organisations. In a defiant inauguration speech on Monday, President Samia Suluhu Hassan said the election was fair and transparent but acknowledged people had died during the protests. She blamed foreign actors for the deadly protests. The death toll is not clear but families continue to search for or bury relatives killed following the recent disputed poll, that Samia won with 98% of the vote. Samia, the soft-spoken leader whose calm and gentle demeanour, initially inspired optimism when she assumed power in 2021 after the sudden death in office of her authoritarian predecessor, John Magufuli. \"Samia has pushed Tanzania to its thick winter of protests, instability and uncertainty,\" Prof Peter Kagwanja, a Kenyan policy analyst, told the BBC. The protests, organised by young people, drew clear parallels with global Gen Z-led mobilisations against entrenched leadership and unresponsive governments. Analysts say while the unrest was unprecedented for Tanzania, it was preceded by a tense political climate - marked by stalled reforms, years of simmering youth anger, power tussles within the ruling party and the sustained persecution of opposition leaders. \"The protests were just a culmination of years of anger and grievances that have been bottled in by Tanzanians,\" Godfrey Mwampembwa, a Tanzanian-born political cartoonist, popularly known as Gado, said. Gado's satirical cartoons depicting President Samia as authoritarian and intolerant of political competition, have been circulated widely on social media. Veteran Tanzanian journalist Jenerali Ulimwengu described in a column how the recent election was \"the boiling point reached by societal soups that have been cooking for decades in a slow cooker without being noticed by an absent-minded rulership, totally submerged in the middle of its gravy train\". Similar sentiments were shared by Gado, who accused the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party of \"burying its head in the sand\" and being \"tone-deaf\" to Tanzanians' growing calls for change. \"CCM has over the years disenfranchised the masses and disregarded the very state institutions that keep it in power, \" said the satirist, who is based in neighbouring Kenya but has been closely following events in his home country. Charles Onyango-Obbo, political commentator on East African matters, agrees that the CCM \"had long mistaken calm for maturity, but it was only age and arrogance hiding behind a glorious history\". \"It confused the people's silence with peace, not realising it was the quiet of exhaustion,\" he wrote. Unlike others in the region, the CCM, which emerged from the Tanganyika African National Union, is a post-colonial liberation party that has maintained a firm grip not only on the levers of power but also on the nation's psyche. But it is the nature of this latest election that has exposed a shocking new side of Tanzania, a country long seen as protest-shy, especially when compared with neighbouring Kenya. In the months preceding election day, the CCM government worked to systematically eliminate any credible competition, according to analysts. The two main opposition leaders were blocked from contesting the poll - Tundu Lissu is in detention on treason charges, which he denies, while Luhaga Mpina's candidacy was rejected on technical grounds. According to Prof Kagwanja, that act alone negated what Tanzania and its founding President Julius Nyerere stood for. \"You don't jail your opponents, you seek to get support from people against the opposition,\" said Prof Kagwanja. Fondly known as Mama Samia, the 65-year-old president is now facing mounting accusations of heading a repressive government responsible for violently crushing historic protests. Her approach to leadership was initially admired both at home and abroad as she allowed opposition parties to organise rallies and criticise the government without the fear of grave repercussions. She had pledged to re-open Tanzania to the world through her \"4R\" doctrine - reconciliation, resilience, rebuilding and reform. Having been born and raised in Zanzibar, a semi-autonomous archipelago known for humility and hospitality, it was unsurprising that Samia inspired a sense of relief when she assumed power in 2021. But analysts say that as Samia set her eyes on a second term, she started seeing internal party pressure within the CCM and the resurgence of the opposition as threats to her ambition. For the last three years, she had reshuffled the cabinet multiple times and replaced  military and intelligence chiefs, in moves seen as weeding out loyalists of her predecessor. \"Within the CCM, she resorted to a Magufuli script of manipulating the party, centralising power and creating a cabal of trusted loyalists as the new fulcrum of power,\" said Prof Kagwanja. Samia's calculated political manoeuvres - which earned her the nickname \"Simba jike\" (Swahili for lioness) among her supporters - paid off as the CCM nominated her as its presidential candidate in January. Months to the election, a wave of abductions, arrests and the brutal killings of opposition members gripped the country, shattering hopes for reforms and reconciliation. The political space had drastically shrunk in the run-up to the recent election, that was overshadowed by an internet blackout and a curfew. Hundreds may have died in post-election unrest according to the opposition. The  authorities are yet to release an official death toll. The violence was shocking for a nation that had cultivated an image of calm, consensus, and order for nearly six decades. \"The myth of Tanzanian exceptionalism lies in ruins,\" stated Mr Onyango-Obbo. In an uncommon critique, the African Union and the regional Southern African Development Community said Samia's electoral victory did not meet accepted democratic standards, citing ballot-stuffing, repression and systemic flaws. The main opposition, the Party for Democracy and Development (Chadema), dismissed the results as \"completely fabricated\". \"Samia's challenge was not winning the election. Instead, it was to win the hearts and minds of Tanzanians and East Africans that she was elected in a fair contest. Lamentably, Samia chose coronation. She closed all avenues to a fair contest,\"  said Prof Kagwanja. As she begins to serve her second term in office, analysts say Samia is facing mounting international scrutiny which could undermine her legitimacy to lead the East African country.

The 41-year-old, from Caerphilly in south Wales, uses medical cannabis to help with his anxiety, but until agreeing to speak to the BBC, nobody Jon worked with realised he took it. \"I was a little bit nervous... Are they going to start thinking you come to work stoned?\" said Jon, one of an estimated tens of thousands of people in the UK with private cannabis prescriptions. The NHS has said the risks of medical cannabis are unclear, while one leading psychiatrist warned it could be harming some patients. \"Private clinics are prescribing high potency cannabis for people with psychiatric disorders such as depression and PTSD,\" Prof Sir Robin Murray, former president of European Psychiatric Association, told the BBC. \"[There's] a lot of evidence that high potency cannabis makes these conditions worse and indeed suicidal,\" he added. Cannabis can only be prescribed by a specialist consultant with proof that other treatments haven't worked. Cannabis \"flower\" - or buds - have hardly ever been prescribed on the NHS since the law changed toallow it for medicinal reasons in 2018, but there is a growing private industry. Most patients we spoke to were paying a few hundred pounds per month to get cannabis. Some patients, like Jon, said that using medical cannabis gave them the benefits they'd hoped to get from medication such as antidepressants. Getting behind the wheel of a car, through security at an airport, or even into a bar or club are all things patients say they have to think about carefully. And they must remember to always take their prescription to avoid being criminalised. Some say they still live in fear of being stopped by police, dismissed from their jobs, or even losing access to their children because of what they describe as the stigma attached to cannabis. One patient told the BBC she had a letter from her neighbour complaining about the smell of cannabis coming from her flat. \"I was scared,\" admitted Kat Turner, 26, who puts pillows in front of her door in an attempt to stop the smell spreading. \"They could have called the police, that was my fear. I use my front door as little as possible because I'm afraid of any smell going into the communal area.\" Kat takes cannabis after being diagnosed with functional neurological disorder, but the drug can also be prescribed for things like PTSD, OCD, anxiety and depression. Jon admitted he was \"nervous\" about telling his work he took medicinal cannabis for his anxiety because he thought his bosses might think he'll be working \"doped up\". \"In films and comedy programmes it's funny to depict people who smoke weed as lazy and clumsy,\" said Jon. \"But really, that's not how it is. It just calms me down a little bit.\" Jon works for one of the country's largest employers and said they've been incredibly supportive - but asked him not to name them. Patients and clinics that prescribe cannabis say there is little public awareness cannabis can be legal with a prescription, and Jon was worried some people just think of a \"lazy stoner\" when talking about someone who uses cannabis. He was first given medical cannabis after a mental health \"breakdown\" in his late 30s. \"I'll get big spikes in my anxiety, dwell on random incidents from the past and start panicking about the most random things,\" said Jon. \"Weed stops all of that for me.\" Jon, who was recently diagnosed with autism and is awaiting a possible ADHD diagnosis, said he was prescribed \"cannabis flower\" - the industry term given to cannabis buds. One condition for Jon being able to access this treatment is that the buds must be vaped, in a special cannabis vaporiser, rather than smoked. Themost recent data suggeststhere were more than 50,000 private cannabis prescriptions in July 2024 - with figures expected to have grown since then. It is not just Kat's neighbours who questioned her cannabis usage, she also was not allowed to take her medicinal cannabis into hospital last year. She says her functional neurological disorder means she can lose \"total control\" of her body, suffering intense tics and seizures. The insurance worker from south Wales was given a three-week in-patient rehabilitation appointment at a specialist NHS unit in Bristol. But she told us despite informing staff before arrival, when she got to the hospital she was told she would not be allowed her cannabis. \"They implied that my medication could be illegal and that they wouldn't be able to really allow it inside,\" said Kat from Cardiff, who uses both cannabis buds and oil. \"They advised that I would only be able to take the medication if I left hospital grounds. \"My main concern at that point was how I was going to leave the grounds to use my medication, because I have mobility issues and I'm very vulnerable. Especially because of my seizures. \"After a lengthy discussion where I was made to feel like a criminal, I had to make the decision to leave. It felt quite devastating. It felt unfair.\" When she was first diagnosed, Kat was told for the best chance of recovery she would need to start treatment within \"three to four weeks\". However, more than three years later treatment had still not begun - and Kat said she relied on cannabis to help control her tics enough to do things like cut up food and brush her teeth. \"Without being able to take my medication and manage my symptoms, I wouldn't have been able to benefit from the treatment that they were offering me.\" In a letter, North Bristol NHS Trust apologised for her experience, but said she was the first patient they had experienced who wanted to vape cannabis, and they were updating their policy to reflect what to do when this happens again. One area where medical cannabis patients said they were seeing more understanding was at gigs and nightclubs. \"I've been able to go to festivals and concerts and things like that with my cannabis on me,\" said Shash Appan, who spends at least £200 a month on her cannabis prescription for PTSD and fibromyalgia. The 29-year-old from Cardiff said she often got \"funny looks\" when heading out into the smoking area on a night out, but when confronted by bouncers had always been able to explain it was medical cannabis without problems. \"One of the main things for me is that I don't have the same degree of night terrors I had before,\" said Shash, who often uses a wheelchair to get around. \"I know for some people the initial effects can be the munchies or laughing, but I'd much rather have that than the depressive, possibly sleepy, side effects of opiates.\" Dr David Howells is one of the few doctors prescribing medical cannabis, and said in the NHS he had often seen the harm cannabis could do to patients with a history of psychosis. But the former NHS psychiatric consultant believes there is growing evidence to support its use for other conditions when supervised by a specialist doctor. \"The greatest evidence base is for anxiety and pain,\" he said. Dr Howells said his own private patient numbers had grown but many were afraid about how they could be judged for using cannabis. \"Concerns about being stopped [by police] or what they should tell an employer are some of the largest concerns of patients coming to our clinic,\" he said. Dr Howells said clinic staff had needed to intervene on a patient's behalf with employers, housing associations, family courts and police - describing understanding of the law around medical cannabis as a \"postcode lottery\". The boss of another clinic had to recently intervene on behalf of other passengers on a UK flight after armed police boarded following reports of a \"cannabis smell\". \"They didn't allow the plane to go before confiscating the medication from the patients and releasing it on the conveyor belt when we got to the destination,\" said Jon Robson of online cannabis clinic Mamedica. \"That would be unheard of with any other type of prescribed medication.\" Driving under the influence of cannabis is illegal, butthere's a medical exemptionproviding patients have followed the dosages prescribed and do not feel impaired. \"We always advise them that they take their medication out within the pots or packages, that would have their name and details on,\" said Dr Howells. \"That would demonstrate that they are using a legal medical product.\" The Police Chiefs' Council said new guidance was being drafted to \"help to alleviate ambiguity\" for police forces around medical cannabis - but reiterated any officer was \"within their rights\" to stop a driver they suspected of being unsafe. Both the General Medical Council and Quality Care Commission pointed us to existing guidelines on prescribing when asked to comment. The NHS has previously said the risks from cannabis products are \"not currently clear\" and the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs are producing a report for the UK government on cannabis-based products for medicinal use. It is due to be published shortly. Details of mental health help and support are available atBBC Action Line"}

The bipartisan bill, which calls for the release of the files \"in a searchable and downloadable format\" within 30 days, cleared the Senate after it was overwhelmingly passed by the House of Representatives on Tuesday. It next needs the sign-off of President Donald Trump. The president urged fellow Republicans on Sunday to vote for the release of the records - abruptly reversing course after previously trying to draw a line under the controversy. He had faced push-back from Epstein victims and a brewing revolt from rank-and-file Republicans demanding the trove of documents be unsealed. Congress' lower chamber began debating the measure on Tuesday morning and voted within hours. Several of Epstein's victims spent the day on Capitol Hill advocating for the bill's passage. Nearly all the House lawmakers voted in favour of the resolution, which passed  427-1. Clay Higgins, a Louisiana Republican, was the only lawmaker who voted against the bill. Two Republicans and three Democrats did not vote. The House Oversight Committee has alreadymade public thousands of documentsfrom the Epstein estate relating to the late financier, but the resolution passed on Tuesday covers material currently in the possession of the justice department. Those records could, in theory, include files about imprisoned Epstein co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell, as well as figures - including government officials - mentioned in the case. It could also include internal justice department documents. On Wednesday morning, the Senate confirmed that it had passed the Epstein bill and sent it to Trump. The president has indicated he will sign the measure, though it is unclear exactly when he will do so. On his Truth Social platform on Tuesday night, he posted that he did not care when the Senate passed the bill. He urged Republicans not to lose sight of \"all of the Victories that we've had\" under his presidency. Once the US president signs the measure, the justice department will have 30 days to release its materials on Epstein. But there are obstacles to the files being shared even if Trump signs the bill. The House bill said the justice department can hold back any documents that \"jeapordise an active federal investigation or ongoing prosecution, provided that such withholding is narrowly tailored and temporary\". That could potentially lead to delays, given that Trump has called for investigations into Epstein's links with prominent Democrats, such as Bill Clintonand Larry Summers, \"to determine what was going on with them, and him\". Clinton has strongly denied he had any knowledge of Epstein's crimes, whereas Summers has apologised for his \"misguided decision\" to continue communicating with Epstein until 2019. \"That's a potential hurdle,\" Jonathan Entin, a constitutional law professor at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio, told the BBC. \"If, in fact, this is a serious investigation, presumably the prosecutors will not want everything out there while they're sorting out whether they bring charges.\" For those who have campaigned for the release of the files, anything short of full disclosure is likely to spark further questions and even outrage. Several Republican lawmakers have expressed worries that Trump's order to the justice department to investigate Epstein's ties could slow the release of the files. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky congressman, vowed that he and fellow Republican dissident Marjorie Taylor Greene, of Georgia, would \"absolutely\" go to the floor of the House and read out the names of \"some of the men\" in the files if the records were not duly released by the justice department. In addition to possible delays, the public is also likely to see lots of redactions in any release of new Epstein documents. In the tranche of files released by the House Oversight Committee last week, names and phone numbers were frequently blacked out to protect privacy. The latest bill says the attorney general can \"withhold or redact\" records that include victims' names, medical files and other personal information that \"would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\". \"Simply letting anything out could reveal a lot of private information that's not relevant or appropriate for public consumption,\" Prof Entin said. The attorney general can also withhold classified material and images of sexual abuse. The justice department has already said that a \"large volume\" of its 300 gigabytes of data from Epstein investigations includes images and videos of minors and thousands of downloaded videos and images of child sex abuse. Other information in the documents could be protected by grand jury secrecy rules, which the latest bill does not explicitly address. US Attorney General Pam Bondi said on Wednesday morning when asked about the Epstein files during an unrelated news conference: \"We'll continue to follow the law with maximum transparency, while protecting victims.\""}

North Yorkshire Council gave approval for construction to progress at a meeting on Tuesday, despite a campaign group's legal challenge. The Transforming Cities Fund (TCF) scheme would see changes to bus station access, a new bus lane on Station Parade and new cycling infrastructure in the town centre. Some residents and businesses have complained, saying the end result does not justify the disruption and expense, and it would be bad for business. North Yorkshire Council's executive member for highways and transport, Malcolm Taylor, said: \"The scheme has been in the making for around five years, with several rounds of consultation and engagement to produce the final designs. \"We have maintained our commitment to delivering the scheme, which will be key in promoting sustainable travel and public transport options. \"The town centre will become more visibly appealing, ultimately driving economic prosperity through improved access to employment and future investment.\" Work is due to begin in the New Year to avoid disruption over the festive period with the scheme due be completed in autumn 2027. However, according to theLocal Democracy Reporting Service, opponents of North Yorkshire Council's plans are to take their case to the Court of Appeal. Campaign group Get Away has been granted permission for a review of a High Court decision to dismiss its legal challenge against traffic regulation orders (TROs) made for the project. The group, which was launched by several Harrogate businesses including A&E Baines Limited and Hornbeam Park Developments, claimed the TROs were issued illegally. Steven Baines, spokesperson for the campaign group, said: \"The council has not undertaken a thorough and transparent process with regard to the Harrogate Gateway scheme – far from it. \"The judge got the decision wrong to dismiss our legal challenge and the Court of Appeal's move to grant us a review of the judge's ruling, on the basis that our case has real prospects of success, says a lot about what we are fighting for and how the council has conducted itself.\" The council acknowledged the legal challenge but said work would continue, as the previous challenge was dismissed on all five grounds.

Captain and pace bowler Pat Cummins will miss the first Test as he recovers from a back injury, while fellow seamer Josh Hazlewood is also absent with a hamstring injury. Scott Boland will come into the side for one of them, with the uncapped Brendan Doggett an option to replace the other. There are also decisions to make around who opens the batting and who is the all-rounder in the side before Thursday night's first Test (02:30 GMT, Friday). BBC Sport profiles each player, including the injured duo of Cummins and Hazlewood, and looks at their Test career and recent form. Who are the players in England's Ashes squad? How to follow the Ashes across the BBC All you need to know about the 2025 Ashes Age:38;Tests:84;Runs:6,053;Average:43.86;Centuries:16 Australia's top order has been problematic in recent times but Khawaja has been the one certainty for this series. The left-hander averages 44.23 in 35 innings against England, with four centuries. His average is 49.90 in home conditions and how he fares in the Ashes may go a long way to deciding the outcome. He averages 53.98 in Tests in 2025 so is in good touch. The 31-year-old has been called up to the squad for the first time, with Sam Konstas, Nathan McSweeney - both of whom made their debut last year - and Matt Renshaw left out. Chief selector George Bailey described Weatherald as \"really solid\" and said they like how he builds an innings and the rate he scores at. However, Bailey stopped short of confirming he would make his debut in Perth. Weatherald averages 37.62 in four Sheffield Shield matches this season, having finished last season as the top run-scorer and with an average of 50.33. Age:31;Tests:58;Runs:4,435;Average:46.19;Centuries:11 For quite a while it felt like Labuschagne would not be part of Australia's squad, but he forced his way back in thanks to a superb start to the domestic season. He has hit five centuries in all formats, including two in the Sheffield Shield, where he averages 67.00 in four innings. His role in the side may depend on the fitness of Cameron Green. If Green can bowl, Labuschagne is likely to bat at three, but he may have to open if Green plays as a specialist batter. Labuschagne was dropped for the Test series in West Indies in July after averaging 25.84 and failing to score a century in 15 Tests. The 31-year-old, who made his Ashes debut as Test cricket's first concussion sub in 2019, averages 40.64 in 14 Tests against England. Age:36;Tests:119;Runs:10,477;Average:56.02;Centuries:36 Smith is the glue in Australia's batting, particularly now he is back at four after a brief stint as an opener. He averages 56.01 against England and 59.70 across his career in Australia. He will captain the side in the first Test in Cummins' absence, but his form is sure to have a huge impact on the outcome of the series. Age:31;Tests:60;Runs:3,963;Average:41.71;Centuries:9 Head is the X-factor in Australia's batting line-up and is capable of taking the game away from England in an hour. The left-hander is short of form, though, with a top score of 31 in eight white-ball innings since the start of October. That resulted in him skipping the final two games of a T20 series against India to play in the last round of Sheffield Shield before the Ashes from 10 November. Head, 31, averages 39.56 in 13 Tests against England and 51.52 in home conditions over his career. Age:26;Tests:32;Runs:1,565;Average:34.02;Wickets:35;Average:35.31 Green was always going to be part of Australia's squad but his role in the side has been up for debate. Having played as a specialist batter because of back injuries, he has returned to bowling in domestic cricket in recent weeks. That opens up the possibility of Green being used as the all-rounder at six in Australia's side, with a batter at three. He averages 27.58 with the bat in eight Tests against England - down on a career average of 34.02 - and has taken 18 wickets. Age:31;Tests:7;Runs:381;Average:34.63;Wickets:8;Average:23.25 The 31-year-old made his Test debut against India last December and has been the all-rounder in the side since. However, the potential bowling return of Green and the form of Labuschagne may mean Webster finds himself out of the side. He made two hard-fought half-centuries in tricky conditions against West Indies, adding to one in the World Test Championship final against South Africa, so he has shown he can be a gritty character when needed. Age:34;Tests:43;Runs:2,010;Average:34.65;Centuries:2;Dismissals:177 Carey is an established part of Australia's side and there is very little pressure on his spot. The left-hander is capable of absorbing pressure or going through the gears with the bat depending on the situation. Careycontroversially stumped Jonny Bairstowin the 2023 Ashes at Lord's, so he has history with England. He averages 21.27 in 10 Tests against England, compared to his career average of 34.65 and 31.68 in home conditions. Age:30;Tests:3;Runs:119;Average:29.75;Centuries:0 Inglis, who was born in Leeds, has been Australia's spare middle-order batter in recent years and continues for the first Test. He is yet to play a Test at home but is a regular in their white-ball side and is an aggressive batter. He will also be the spare keeper if anything happens to Alex Carey. He averaged 72.60 in three Sheffield Shield games last year. Age:32;Tests:71;Wickets:309;Average:22.10;Best figures:6-23 Cummins will miss the opening Test in Perth but has ramped up his preparations with the aim of being available for the second game in Brisbane. He is fourth in the International Cricket Council's Test bowling rankings and has taken 91 wickets in 19 Ashes Test at an average of 24.10. Cummins averages 19.92 in home conditions throughout his career and Joe Root is the batter he has dismissed the most (11). Age:35;Tests:100;Wickets:402;Average:27.02;Best figures:6-9 Starc is a new-ball menace in all conditions, but particularly in day-night Tests. The left-armer has 81 wickets and averages 17.08 in 14 pink-ball Tests, so watch out for him in Brisbane. He has taken 97 wickets in 22 Ashes Tests at an average of 27.37, removing Ben Stokes nine times and Joe Root eight. Starc is handy with the bat too, averaging 20.19 against England, with 11 half-centuries. Age:34;Tests:76;Wickets:295;Average:24.21;Best figures:6-67 Hazlewood has been an integral part of a formidable trio alongside Cummins and Starc - whom he shares new-ball duties with - for several years. He has taken 76 wickets at an average of 25.97 in 18 Ashes Tests and averages 22.70 in home Tests over his career. He has removed Root 10 times - more than any other batter. He will miss at least the first Test after suffering a hamstring injury while playing in the Sheffield Shield. He missed three of the five Tests against India in Australia's most recent home summer any prolonged absence would impact their chances. Age:36;Tests:14;Wickets:62;Average:16.53;Best figures:6-7 Boland has been the spare seamer around Australia's squad since making his debut in the 2021 Ashes. He is a more than dependable replacement and is set to feature in the first Test in Cummins' absence. Boland has taken 20 wickets in five Tests against England, averaging 20.15, while across his whole Test career he averages a ridiculous 12.63 in home conditions. However, England attacked him in the 2023 series on home soil, when he averaged 48. Expect the same approach this time round. Age:37;Tests:139;Wickets:562;Average:30.14;Best figures:8-50 Off-spinner Lyon is the seventh-most prolific bowler in Test history and needs only two wickets to climb above compatriot Glenn McGrath into sixth. Pitches in Australia have produced more movement in recent years, so Lyon's influence has decreased slightly, as shown by his nine wickets at 36.88 apiece against India last year. There is a chance he may not make the team in some Ashes Tests, but he has often been England's nemesis, taking 110 wickets in 30 Tests at 29.41. Lyon was injured in the 2023 Ashes and famously hobbled out to bat at Lord's, but he will be keen to write some more positive memories in what is likely to be his last series against England. Abbott has been a pretty regular part of Australia's white-ball teams in recent years but has not featured in Tests. He has been part of squads but has been unable to break up the formidable Cummins-Hazlewood-Starc trio. He took one wicket in his Sheffield Shield game this season but is expected to play in the round of matches that start on 10 November. He claimed 19 wickets at an average of 21.94 last season. He averages 24.62 with the bat in first-class cricket so would add batting depth to Australia if called upon. He isn't an option for the opening Test though after suffering a hamstring injury. Doggett will be the other spare seamer in the squad after impressing in Sheffield Shield cricket in recent years. He claimed match figures of 7-86 in his only outing this season, having taken 33 wickets at 24.15 apiece last season. He had a three-game spell with Durham this summer, taking nine wickets in three matches at 33.44. Age:35;Tests:2;Wickets:7;Average:16.71;Best figures:3-22 Neser was added to the squad after injuries to Hazlewood and Abbott. He got the call over Fergus O'Neill who has impressed in Shield cricket. Neser has taken 14 wickets at an average of 24.28 in Australia's red-ball competition this season. He may be behind Doggett in the pecking order now but he's a solid option if Australia decide to go that way. All ages and stats correct as of 17 November.

At the end of a G7 foreign ministers meeting in Canada, Rubio said the RSF had committed systematic atrocities, including murder, rape and sexual violence against civilians. Sudan's army accuses the United Arab Emirates of propping up the RSF with weapons and mercenaries sent via African nations. The UAE and the RSF have repeatedly denied these allegations. The RSF has been fighting the Sudanese army since April 2023, when a power struggle between their leaders erupted into all-out civil war. Rubio's comments are some of the most outspoken so far by the Trump administration about the war in Sudan and the actions of the RSF, but it is not clear how much impact they will have. A previous US-backed proposal for a humanitarian ceasefire in Sudan has already been violated by the RSF, even though they agreed to it last week. El-Fasher was captured last month by the RSF after an 18-month siege, meaning they now control all of the cities in the vast western Darfur region. Only a small fraction of the population has managed to flee the city, where massacres are said to have take taken place. Piles of bodies on the ground and blood-stained earthare visible from space in satellite imagery. Non-Arab groups in the wider Darfur region are being systematically targeted by the RSF in what amounts to genocide, according to the US and humanitarian groups. At the talks near Niagara Falls on Wednesday, America's top diplomat said women and children had been targeted in acts of the most horrific kind by the RSF in el-Fasher. Rubio told reporters: \"They're committing acts of sexual violence and atrocities, just horrifying atrocities, against women, children, innocent civilians of the most horrific kind.  And it needs to end immediately. \"And we're going to do everything we can to bring it to an end, and we've encouraged partner nations to join us in this fight.\" However, Rubio stopped short of publicly criticising Abu Dhabi, in spite of evidence that the Gulf state is the RSF's main arms supplier, presented in investigations by the international media that the UN has found credible. The Trump administration is working for an end to the war together with the UAE, as well as Egypt and Saudi Arabia, who are allies of Sudan's military-led government, collectively known as the \"Quad\". \"I don't want to get into calling anybody out at a press conference today, because what we want is a good outcome here,\" Rubio said on Wednesday, but added pointedly: \"We know who the parties are that are involved [in weapons supply]... That's why they're part of the Quad along with other countries involved.\" In September, the Quad jointly proposed a three-month humanitarian truce, followed by a permanent ceasefire and a nine-month transition to civilian rule. In a statement on Thursday, the UAE expressed \"alarm at the heinous attacks against civilians by RSF forces in El Fasher\". It went on to accuse the Sudanese army of \"starvation tactics, indiscriminate bombardment of populated areas, and the reported use of chemical weapons\". These are accusations the army has previously denied. The RSF waited until it had captured el-Fasher before announcing that it was agreeing to the truce. Sudan's army says it objects to the UAE's presence in the Quad but will still consider the proposal. In the meantime, there has been no let-up in the fighting. The secretary of state rejected the paramilitary group's attempt to blame the killings on rogue elements, saying this was false and the attacks were systematic. Asked by the BBC about his assessment of the likely scale of atrocities, he said the US feared that thousands of people who had been expected to flee el-Fasher were either dead or too malnourished to move. He said the RSF, lacking its own arms manufacturing facilities, relied on outside support, and called for countries supplying weapons to stop. In response the RSF issued a lengthy statement denouncing what it called \"all biased statements against them\". The paramilitary group repeated denials that it does not receive support from external parties and said it did not accept attempts to scapegoat it in order to cover up the army's rejection of the truce. \"The party that has rejected all ceasefire initiatives and refused to engage in them is the army affiliated with the terrorist Islamic Movement,\" it said, \"while our forces responded in good faith officially announcing their approval. Yet to this day we have not received any reply from the US side. So, where is the other party and where is its response?\" The joint G7 statement also condemned surging violence in Sudan, saying the conflict between the army and the RSF had triggered \"the world's largest humanitarian crisis\". To date, more than 150,000 people have been killed and about 12 million have had no choice but to flee their homes. The flow of weapons into the country during this two-year-long civil war has been analysed by various experts. Amnesty International says it has found evidence of weapons manufactured in Serbia, Russia, China, Turkey, Yemen and UAE being used in Sudan. The smuggling route is often via the UAE, through to Chad, then into Darfur -according to a leaked report by UN experts. The UAE in particular is accused of providing arms and support to the RSF, who in turn are accused of using the UAE as a marketplace for illicit gold sales. On Wednesday, Rubio pointedly said assistance to the RSF \"isn't just coming from some country that's paying for it - it's also coming from countries that are allowing their territory to be used to ship it and transport it\". He also said he did not want to \"diminish\" the involvement of other actors in the conflict, saying \"that includes potentially the Iranians, at least money and weapons being flown into the other side\", meaning to the Sudanese army. All parties deny these allegations. A fortnight ago, the UK government came under fire from its own lawmakers following allegations that British-made weapons were ending up in the hands of the RSF, who were using them to commit atrocities. In response to one MP's demand to \"end all arms shipments to the UAE until it is proved that the UAE is not arming the RSF\", Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said at the time: \"The UK has extremely strong controls on arms exports, including to prevent any diversion. We will continue to take that immensely seriously.\" There has been a UN arms embargo on the RSF's stronghold of Darfur since 2004, but it has not been extended to the rest of the country despite calls from human rights groups.

Victoria Bond, 40,a public relations consultant from Cornwall, was named by authorities in Chile as among those killed in the tourist hotspot of Torres del Paine National Park, in the south of the country. Along with Ms Bond, two German and two Mexican citizens died in the snowstorm, according to Jose Antonio Ruiz, the presidential delegate of the Magallanes region of southern Chile. Their bodies were found on Tuesday. Visit Isles of Scilly chairman Andrew Sells said the organisation, which Ms Bond worked for, was \"utterly devastated\" by her death. Visit Isles of Scilly said Ms Bond had headed up its public relations for more than six years and was on a \"trip of lifetime\" with friends in Argentina and Chile. She was out hiking when she became trapped in the storm, the organisation said. Mr Sells said she had \"worked tirelessly\" in her role to promote the islands, 28 miles off the Cornish coast, and was an \"integral part\" of the team. He said: \"She was always a joy to work with, and I cannot praise her work too highly. She is an enormous loss to the community.\" Euan Rodger, executive vice-chairman of Visit Isles of Scilly, said the organisation was \"heartbroken\". \"She brought life, energy, and an infectious enthusiasm to every project, making her a true joy to work alongside,\" he said. Adrian Jones, who worked with Ms Bond promoting the Roseland Festival in Cornwall, paid tribute to her as \"lovable, witty and creative\". \"She was a doer... she had ideas and she saw them through,\" he said. \"She will leave a huge hole in Portscatho... she lived in Newquay but she spent a lot of the time in Portscatho.\" He described her as adventurous. \"Unbelievably sad as it may seem, she was doing what she lived life for,\" he said. Chilean officials said the search for victims had ended and the focus was now on repatriating the bodies and liaising with foreign consulates. Chilean President Gabriel Boric Font paid tribute to search and rescue teams who worked in \"intense\" snowfall and winds reaching speeds of up to 118mph (190km/h). He said in a post onX: \"To the families, friends, and loved ones of the five individuals of Mexican, German, and British nationalities who tragically lost their lives in the incident that occurred in Torres del Paine, I extend my deepest condolences. \"Know that you have the full support and collaboration of Chilean authorities and institutions during these difficult times.\" The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said: \"We are supporting the family of a British woman who has died following an incident in Chile and are in contact with the local authorities.\" Follow BBC Cornwall onX,FacebookandInstagram.

In what is believed to be a first for the country, Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla is being prosecuted over what she wrote on social media four years ago during deadly protests. Jacob Zuma's nine-year presidency, littered with controversies, came to a halt in 2018 amid extensive graft allegations - all denied. Then in 2021 he was jailed for failing to show up at a corruption inquiry, triggering protests and the worst scenes of violence since before the start of the democratic era in 1994. A week of anarchy in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng provinces, including looting and arson, left at least 300 people dead and caused an estimated $2.8bn (£2.2bn) damage. Prosecutors allege Zuma-Sambudla played a central role in stoking this. This unique trial will be a chance for the state's legal team to prove its mettle in successfully prosecuting cases relating to the 2021 unrest, but the accused sees it as an attempt to settle political scores with her father. He is now an opposition leader after leaving the African National Congress (ANC) and joining a rival party, uMkhonto weSizwe (MK). In recent years Zuma-Sambudla has emerged as the former president's most stalwart supporter regularly seen by his side. She has also become an MK member of parliament. In 2021, she was outraged by his incarceration and posted images from the looting. The allegation is that these praised what was happening and incited her legion of social media followers, some 100,000 at the time, to press on with the mayhem. Zuma-Sambudla is accused of the incitement to commit terrorism under the Protection of Constitutional Democracy against Terrorist and Related Activities Act. She is also accused of the incitement to commit public violence. She has denied the charges, with her lawyer describing the state's case as \"weak\". She used a procedural hearing ahead of the trial to take shots at the prosecution, wearing a shirt ironically branded with the words \"Modern Day Terrorist\". Several dozen posts from July 2021 on what was then known as Twitter are at the heart of the state's case against her. In one tweet, she shared a film of a vehicle transporter ablaze and stacked with cars shot at Mooi Plaza, a tollgate near one of the towns in KwaZulu-Natal hardest hit by the violence. Along with the hashtag #FreeJacobZuma she wrote: \"Mooi Plaza…We See You!!! Amandla\", along with three fist emojis. \"Amandla\" means power in the Zulu language and was a well-known slogan in the resistance movement against white-minority apartheid rule. In another tweet she shared a poster calling for the \"shut down\" of KwaZulu-Natal including \"roads, factories, shops [and] government\" until the former president was released. She also included the Zulu word \"azishe\" which literally means \"let it burn\" but in slang can mean \"let it start\" or \"let it proceed\". The MP was born and raised in Mozambique, where her father was living in exile after spending a decade as a political prisoner in South Africa. She grew up with her twin brother Duduzane and was one of Zuma's five children with his third wife Kate Mantsho - who took her own life in 2000. Duduzile and Duduzane are arguably the most well-known of Zuma's rumoured 20 children with several wives and former partners. For several years, it was Duduzane who dominated headlines after his association with the controversial Gupta family came to light in the early 2010s. That family was at the centre of the corruption allegations that plagued the Zuma presidency. The Guptas and Zuma have denied any wrongdoing. Apart from her lavish wedding to businessman Lonwabo Sambudla in 2011, dubbed the wedding of the year at the time, Zuma-Sambudla kept out of the spotlight. She mostly focused on raising her two daughters and being a housewife, according to South Africa's Daily Maverick news site. She separated from her husband in 2017. It was around that time that she was seen increasingly at her father's side whenever he appeared in public, either in court or at political events - as a result the spotlight turned towards her. Zuma-Sambudla backed her father when he joined the MK party. Despite being a political novice, she now has a seat in parliament, after last year's general election, and is an influential figure in the party despite holding no official position. She was also appointed to the African Union's Pan-African Parliament. Aside from her controversial 2021 tweets, Zuma-Sambudla has become adept at using her social media accounts to show off her regimented fitness routine, provide glimpses into her private life and throw the occasional barb at her political opponents. Her higher public profile now makes the case against her \"very highly politicised with a strong public interest\", Willem Els, from think-tank the Institute for Security Studies, told the BBC. Political science academic Prof Bheki Mngomezulu believes the case is politically motivated and a \"way of fighting her father\". \"If she wasn't the daughter of the former president, chances are these charges would have been dropped a long time ago,\" he argued. Both experts also questioned the delay in charging her. The police's elite corruption-busting agency, the Hawks, confirmed her arrest in January this year - nearly four years after the deadly protests. \"The fact that so few unrest-related cases have reached conviction also raises eyebrows around whether the prosecution is selective,\" Mr Els said. There have only been a handful of other cases relating to the violence in 2021 that have reached court. The South African Human Rights Commission, in a statement released earlier this year, indicated that 66 possible cases were currently with the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) but it faced challenges due to a \"general lack of evidence... and hesitations by witnesses to co-operate or testify due to fears of reprisal and victimisation\". In the Zuma-Sambudla case, the \"high evidentiary bar\" will be a big challenge for the prosecutors to show that it was not \"just commentary or protest\". \"Prosecutors need to prove intent and causation that a post directly incited terrorism,\" Mr Els said. He added that there were \"few successful prosecutions\" under the relevant legislation and that it was the first time in South Africa's \"legal history that someone has been charged specifically with incitement of terrorism via social media\". NPA spokesperson Mthunzi Mhaga acknowledged in January that the case was \"complex in nature\" and prosecutors had to bring in external \"experts on social media because [the police don't] have an expert on social media\". The NPA, however, would not have taken it this far if it was not confident with the case it had built, Mr Els added. The MK has slammed the case against Zuma-Sambudla  as a \"social injustice\", while spokesperson Nhlamulo Ndlela dismissed the \"trumped up charges\" as a \"political ploy\" and persecution. Regardless of whether the prosecution is successful or not the party could make hay from the case and present her as a martyr. Meanwhile, it is likely to generate massive interest from the public and become part of the country's continuing Zuma drama. Go toBBCAfrica.comfor more news from the African continent.

The pair ran away as their armed captors were leading them into the bushes and got away across farmland, Hussaini Aliyu of Danko Wasagu council said. He added that the girls were \"back and are safe\", but one of them needed medical treatment as she had hurt her leg while fleeing. The assault left two members of staff dead - a teacher was killed while trying to protect girls and a security guard later died in hospital from gunshot wounds. A team of soldiers, police and volunteers are combing forested areas in an attempt to rescue the captives seized by the gunmen. \"You must continue day and night fighting. We must find these children,\" Maj Gen Waidi Shaibu, Nigeria's army chief of staff, told troops sent to Kebbi state. Over the past decade, schools in northern Nigeria have become frequent targets for armed groups, who often carry out abductions to seek ransom payments or leverage deals with the government. Police say the gunmen, described locally as \"bandits\", invaded the Government Girls Comprehensive Secondary School in Maga town at about 04:00 (03:00 GMT) on Monday. Parents face an agonising wait. One inconsolable father, whose daughter is still being held captive, told BBC Hausa that his family had been crying non-stop and \"it's hard to go back home and look at their faces\". He said he had two daughters enrolled at the school one of whom had successfully hid from the attackers, but the other had not been so lucky. \"My two daughters hid in the toilet when the armed men invaded their hostel. \"When the [gunmen] ordered all those hiding to come out, or else they'll kill them, one of my daughters got scared and came out,\" the father said. He added that he had heard of the abductions after the Muslim early-morning prayer on Monday, and had rushed to the school and been there ever since. \"My daughter is a very bright and easy-going person,\" he said. Police say the attackers \"engaged police personnel on duty in a gun duel\" before climbing over the perimeter fence and taking the girls from their hostel. The security guard who died had a granddaughter and great-granddaughter at the same school and they are among those kidnapped. \"I found him in his pool of blood,\" the security guard's daughter told the BBC. \"Then they took my daughter and also my granddaughter.\" She said she had been unable to eat or sleep ever since. The attack highlights the persistent security crisis plaguing the region, leaving families in a state of fear. Nigeria's central government says it is \"deeply concerned\" by the abductions. In a statement on Monday, Information Minister Mohammed Idris Malagi said the authorities \"share in the pain\" of the affected families and were working urgently to rescue the girls.

Cyprus-based Columbia Shipmanagement said all 21 crew members of Talara were \"safe and in good spirits\", and that the vessel was \"free to resume normal operations\". There was no immediate confirmation from Iranian authorities. The Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) said on Saturday that it had intercepted Talara after it was found to be \"in violation of the law by carrying unauthorised cargo\". However, Columbia Shipmanagement said \"no allegations were made against the vessel, her crew and the vessel's managers and owners\" before its release on Wednesday morning. Talara had been sailing to Singapore from the United Arab Emirates with a cargo of high-sulphur gasoil on Friday when it was seized around 20 nautical miles (37km) off the Emirati port of Khor Fakkan and diverted to the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas. In recent years, the IRGC has periodically seized tankers and cargo vessels in the Strait of Hormuz and the Gulf, through which about 20% of global oil and gas shipments pass. However, this was the first seizure since Iran's 12-day war with Israel in June."}

Charlie Rolls, 24, grew up on a farm in Longstowe, Cambridgeshire, and started competing in bike trials when he was six years old. In his youth hemade his own courseon the farm and now, he has just competed in the UCI Urban Cycling World Championships in Riyadh, where he won the title. \"I've built up for this for so long and to finally have it, it's more shock than anything so I don't think it's really sunk in. The sport involves riders balancing and controlling their bike over an obstacle course without putting a foot down. Rolls had already won the European Championship last month as well as the season's World Cup, and said he had trained a lot to prepare for the world championships. His training also included sessions in a sauna to prepare for the high temperatures, but preparing his mind was also key. \"I write down in a book how I feel during a session and say what I've done well, what I can work on, and that really helps me mentally to put it together and train efficiently,\" he said. Rolls faced tough competition in the World Championship final, but the moment he knew he had won he celebrated by jumping into the course's water element. \"Straight after it was almost like relief because during the competition, it goes on for about an hour, and during that time I am telling myself to stay calm, try not to feel any emotion, not get excited or nervous,\" he continued. \"As soon as you realise you won, it's like shock and you still can't believe it... you're questioning it.\" Rolls said standing on the podium receiving his medal was an \"emotional\" moment as he reflected on his journey and those that had supported him. He arrived back in the UK on Sunday morning and was greeted at home by friends and family, along with some champagne. He now plans to rest and heal a small knee injury before looking ahead to next year's season. Follow Cambridgeshire news onBBC Sounds,Facebook,InstagramandX."}

The 50-year-old, who has already been jailed for life, has been convicted of molesting the girl in the late-1980s, when he was 14, and raping the woman during a relationship more than 20 years later. Jurors at the Old Bailey found him guilty of nine offences and he is due to be sentenced on Thursday. Carrick, from Stevenage, is alreadyservinga minimum term of 32 years in prison, having admitted 71 offences of sexual violence committed over a 17-year period. Carrick, wearing a suit and tie, was joined by four prison officers in the dock. He shook his head repeatedly as the verdicts were read out. The jury deliberated for five hours before finding him unanimously guilty of the following offences: Lawyer Shilpa Shah, who led both prosecutions by the Crown Prosecution Service against Carrick, has issued a statement about the latest court case. \"It was clear from the compelling testimonies given by these women that they had endured relentless abuse to which they did not consent,\" she said. \"One victim was a child when she was indecently assaulted and another was sexually abused by him while he served as a senior police officer. \"These factors made it vital to prosecute him a second time - not only because of the severity of the crimes and the public interest arising from him being a police officer when he committed some of them, but also to show the full extent of his offending which spanned decades.\" Hertfordshire Police praised the victims for their bravery and urged any others to come forward. During the trial, jurors heard how Carrickabused a young girl for about 18 monthsbefore she told her mother what was going on. Carrick confessed to that abuse in a letter which was recovered from his medical records and signed \"Dave\". The court also heard how the other victimhad been in a \"toxic relationship\"where she had been repeatedly raped. A police interview with that woman was played in court where she described how Carrick had  strangled her, called her abusive names and kicked her out of the house. She said their relationship was \"quite traumatising - I wish I'd never met him\". Carrickdeclined to give evidencein the current Old Bailey trial, but he had denied the new charges, whereas he admitted the previous charges during the court appearances in 2022 and 2023. Prosecutor Tom Little KC told jurors his silence in the dock was \"deafening\". Despite his written confession, Carrick dismissed the new allegations of child abuse, claiming the girl was a liar. Regarding his ex-partner, he had claimed during an interview at Full Sutton prison that the sex had been consensual and accused her of being motivated by the MeToo movement. The sentencing hearing is due to begin on Thursday morning. Follow Beds, Herts and Bucks news onBBC Sounds,Facebook,InstagramandX."}

It announced over €50m (£44m) worth of funding for projects as part of the Shared Island initiative. The initiative, headed by Taoiseach (Irish PM) Micheál Martin, aims to strengthen economies on both sides of the border. The Irish government has now doubled its spending commitment through the fund, allocating it €2bn (£1.76bn) until 2035. The flight route will start next year for a defined period and be reviewed after two years. It will be funded under a Public Service Obligation (PSO), where a government support flights which would not otherwise be commercially viable. It will initially be resourced through the Shared Island Fund as a \"public service obligation\" air service. A previous daily service between City of Derry Airport and Dublin, funded by the Irish government,was withdrawn in 2011. The Irish government hopes the air service will improve connectivity to the north west of the island while the A5 corridor is being worked on. The government is also investing €5.9m (£5.2m) into developing cross-border emergency services, focused on flooding and technical rescue operations. The National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management (NDFEM) and the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service (NIFRS) will \"strengthen their co-operation\" with investment from the fund. This will see expanded training facilities, investing in rescue training equipment and more resources put into flood containment. Joint training by fire and emergency services will also take place on both sides of the border. Some €14.5m (£12.8m) will be allocated for arts projects from 2026 and 2028. This includes the Irish Department of Culture, Communications and Sport carrying out an assessment of a proposed capital funding contribution towards the building of Newry Theatre. A spokeswoman for Derry City and Strabane District Council, owners of City of Derry airport, said the PSO route to Dublin \"represents a strategic opportunity for us to strengthen links, improve access for business and tourism\". \"This service when it is operational will significantly enhance regional connectivity, support economic growth and promote balanced regional development,\" she said. Steve Bradley, from the Into The West lobby group, said any improvement to the region's connectivity is to be welcomed. \"Our roads aren't great, our rail almost absent and our airport is struggling. Anything that adds to the options to our airport are to be welcomed – it is kind of symbolic how bad infrastructure in the north west is that we need an aeroplane to get us on a 140 mile journey,\" he toldBBC Radio Foyle. Cormac Campbell, BBC News NI south-east reporter Among the projects highlighted in Tuesday's announcement is the construction of the new Newry Theatre. In a nutshell it would see the demolition and rebuilding of the city's existing Arts centre, the refurbishment of the adjacent Town Hall and the linking of the two. This is a project that has been developed over a number of years and is part of a wider city regeneration scheme linked to the local council, the Executive and the Belfast region city deal. Part of that wider plan also includes the development of a new Civic Centre - objections to which have slowed down the delivery of the more popular theatre scheme. Indeed, theproject's websitestates that building work was due to begin in summer 2025, a target that has now passed. It's thought that the Irish government intervention could allow the decoupling of the theatre plan from the Civic Centre, thus fast tracking building work. Although no exact amount has been attached to the Irish government's commitment it's thought to be in the region of just under €5m. Sean Treanor, of Newpoint Players, told BBC News NI that since the Sean Hollywood Arts Centre closed its doors five and a half years ago drama groups in the city, like theirs, have had to \"beg\" to secure practice and performance space. \"The project was first mooted before Covid and then the Arts centre never reopened after that,\" he said. \"All the arts groups have had to be resourceful and I find myself begging rehearsal space off my football club. \"The local Fèis had to set up temporary accommodation over at the Quays [Shopping Centre] and they have 14,000 performances over 44 days.\" Mr Treanor said the announcement has been a long time coming. \"We've had to be patient over a very long period of time and patience has been exhausted,\" he said. \"There have been so many false dawns for us so there is surprise and delight at today's news.\" Tuesday's announcement also features a €6.4m (£5.64m) investment for a cross-border pilot regional cooperation programme on tackling Bovine TB. This project will be undertaken by the Irish Agriculture Minister and his Northern Ireland counterpart to tackle bovine TB and see implementation of measures on a coordinated regional basis until the end of the decade. \"This is the Shared Island Initiative in action - working with ambition to establish greater connectivity, deepen co-operation and strengthen island-wide community understanding - to create a shared future together,\" said Martin. \"Those communities will bring a unique and an important perspective to the exploration of our shared island of the past, present and future, shaped by their own immigrant experiences,\" said Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Harris. A Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera) spokesperson said minister Andrew Muir and the department welcomed the funding announced by the Irish government for the programme tackling Bovine TB and another which would \"create a landscape where wild bees can thrive, with all the benefits that will bring for our biodiversity\". \"We look forward to working with our counterparts in the Irish government and other stakeholders in the delivery of these projects,\" they added."}

Names of victims have been changed and identifying details omitted to protect their privacy and safety. Enat was at home with her eight-year-old niece when the soldiers came one Sunday morning, she says. The Ethiopian army was carrying out searches of homes in the Amhara region on 5 January this year, as part of a crackdown on a growing rebellion launched by local militias known as Fano. Enat says three men, dressed in army uniform, entered her home in South Gondar and began asking questions about her family background and whether Fano fighters had visited the beer hall where she worked. \"How could we lie? How can we hide the truth?\" Enat says, noting that Fano - an Amharic word loosely translated as volunteer fighters - is made up of locals. After asking questions about her family background, Enat says the soldiers began insulting her, then threatened her niece with a gun when the little girl started crying. Enat says one of the soldiers then raped her in front of her niece while the others kept guard. \"I begged them not to hurt me. I called on the saints and begged them. But their hearts didn't pity me. They violated me.\" Enat, who is from the Amhara ethnic group, the second largest in Ethiopia, is among thousands of women believed to have been sexually assaulted and raped since the conflict between the Ethiopian army and Fano started in August 2023. Sexual violence in the region is largely undocumented, but the BBC has collated data which shows there have been thousands of reports of rape between July 2023 and May 2025, with victims as young as eight and as old as 65. While restrictions have prevented independent media from entering Amhara to cover the conflict, the BBC team in Nairobi, in neighbouring Kenya, managed to speak to women and doctors in the region, offering a rare insight into the human impact of the crisis. The conflict began when the government attempted to disband regional military groups, including those in Amhara, which had fought with the army during the 2020-2022 civil war in the next-door region of Tigray. Fano militias felt betrayed by the move and believed it would leave them vulnerable to attack from Tigray and elsewhere, especially as violence against the Amhara community had intensified, according to rights groups. In response, Fano launched a rebellion, seizing major towns. They claim to be fighting for regional autonomy and protecting their communities from marginalisation by the Ethiopian government. The insurgency has resulted in a violent crackdown by the army, which calls Fano \"radical ethno-nationalists\". Since the conflict started, both sides have been accused of numerous human rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings, arbitrary detentions, forced displacement, destruction of property, looting and widespread cases of sexual violence, including rape. Rights groups, including Amnesty International, say there is evidence the army is disproportionately responsible for the abuses. They also say that Amhara people in other parts of Ethiopia have been deliberately targeted by the security forces and other armed groups. Before she was attacked, Enat had never had sex and planned to one day marry at her local church in a ceremony conducted in accordance with the Ethiopian Orthodox Church's rites, just as other women in her family had done. Such marriages are among the most revered traditions of the Amhara people, who are predominantly Orthodox Christian, but it requires couples to remain \"pure\" and not have any sexual contact until marriage. \"Before that day, I had never known a man,\" she says. \"It would have been better if they had killed me.\" Tigist, 18, from West Gojjam, also in the Amhara region, worked in her family's small, traditional teahouse before she was attacked. She describes how, in January 2024, a soldier who was a regular customer groped her. She says she rejected him - an act she believes led to the attack. Later that evening, as she was returning home from work, she says three soldiers, including the man who groped her, ambushed her in the street and gang-raped her on the pavement. \"My family found me unconscious on the roadside,\" she recalls. \"They carried me to the clinic, where I spent five days.\" Since the attack, Tigist says she's been unable to leave her house, paralysed by fear of men and the outside world. \"My fear keeps me from going to work... Whenever I see soldiers or any men I panic and hide myself away.\" She ended up retreating from her life and breaking off her engagement. She says she never told her fiance why or what happened. Overwhelmed by despair, Tigist attempted to take her own life, but her family intervened just in time and saved her. She says that although she has contemplated suicide since then, she has promised her family she will not try to kill herself again. The BBC collected data from 43 health facilities in Amhara - roughly 4% of all health facilities in the region - and other medical sources to get a snapshot of what has been happening. At these facilities, there were 2,697 reports of rape between 18 July 2023 and May 2025. Children under 18 accounted for 45% of cases. Just over half of the victims tested positive for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), while many were also left pregnant and with severe psychological trauma. However, many victims of sexual violence never report the crime or seek treatment, fearful of stigma or of learning they may have contracted an STI or become pregnant. For this reason, a senior health expert, who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity due to security concerns, says the victims who come to facilities in the Amhara region are only \"the tip of the iceberg\". Lemlem is among those who have never reported their rape or sought medical treatment, terrified of learning that she might have a sexually transmitted infection, such as HIV. The 23-year-old from South Gondar says government soldiers entered her house on 6 January to ask for information, a routine army practice. She says when she didn't give them what they wanted, one of the soldiers raped her. \"He threatened me, saying: 'If you scream, one bullet is enough for you,'\" Lemlem says. \"I wept non-stop for a whole month. I couldn't eat. All I did was cry. I couldn't stand to walk. And I fell gravely ill.\" She says the assault has driven her away from church, where she fears she may be the subject of gossip. \"It's repulsive to have been born a woman. If I were a man, they might have beaten me and walked away - they wouldn't have destroyed my life like this,\" says Lemlem, explaining how the trauma of the attack has made her feel about being female. Medics the BBC spoke to say there has been a sharp rise in the number of victims of sexual violence that they have been treating since the conflict began. \"They arrive trembling, too intimidated even to speak,\" one medic says. Yet those who do come forward are reluctant to name their attackers and rarely seek justice, in part because the conflict has led to a breakdown in law and order.  Instead, most who do seek medical assistance come out of fear of pregnancy. Others seek treatment long after they have been attacked, by which point certain medications for the STIs they have contracted, such as HIV, are no longer effective. HIV can often be prevented with a treatment called post-exposure prophylaxis, but only if it is administered soon after sex with someone who was infected. Another medic notes that many victims say they are unable to access treatment promptly due to transport disruption and road blockages caused by the conflict. A senior medic warns they fear a public health and social crisis could be looming. Based on information health centres have gathered, they say that they \"have identified signs that HIV infections may rise and that mental health and psychological problems could reach catastrophic levels\", noting that some victims have attempted suicide. Figures from Ethiopia's health ministry in 2022 showed that the HIV rate in the region was around 1.1 per 100 people - higher than the national average. While assaults have been carried out by both sides in the conflict, medical staff report seeing more cases involving Ethiopian army soldiers than Fano militia. A government employee with access to relevant information, who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity, also said this was the case. Most incidents of rape were reported in urban areas where the army maintains bases and exerts control, however experts point out that people living in cities have better access to treatment so are more likely to get help and report attacks. The BBC was unable to interview any victims of assaults by Fano fighters due to limited access to places where the militia are based. In June 2024, the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights reported that the Ethiopian National Defence Force, which includes the army, had perpetrated sexual violence, including against minors, in the Amhara region during the conflict with Fano militia. The BBC asked Ethiopia's ministry of defence to respond to allegations, but despite months of waiting, we have not received a reply. Repeated BBC requests for detailed information from regional authorities were also unsuccessful. A Fano leader, Asres Mare Damtie, told the BBC the group was unaware of any involvement by its fighters, saying no accusations had been made against them and it enforces severe punishment, including death, for offenders. The BBC has learned that a government-commissioned investigation led by Ethiopia's Bahir Dar University into conflict-related sexual violence against women in Amhara has begun, with findings expected to be released publicly in the coming months. In 2021, when the army and its allies - which then included Fano - faced similar allegations over their conduct in the Tigray conflict, the government condemned the use of rape but dismissed the claims as \"biased and flawed\". To date, no official action has been publicly disclosed against perpetrators. Amnesty International has raised concerns over what it believes is a persistent pattern of impunity in Ethiopia's army. \"There is no meaningful effort to bring perpetrators into justice,\" says the organisation's regional researcher, Haimanot Ashenafi. \"They're still fighting, they are still out there with no consequences for what they've done… survivors who have gone through this life-changing experience deserve justice.\" For Enat, the consequences of her attack have been far-reaching. A month after the assault, she fled her village to escape the trauma of the attack. It was then she learned she was pregnant as a result of the rape. \"I started vomiting,\" she recalls. She thought of having an abortion, which is legally permitted in Ethiopia up to 12 weeks into pregnancy if a woman is raped, but she was scared. \"I feared God, and I felt for my mother. What would become of her if I died during the abortion?\" She gave birth to a daughter in early September after three days of labour. Despite what happened to her, Enat considers the baby a \"gift from God\". But she is currently living with a relative and is unable to work as she has to look after her daughter. She worries for the future and how she will provide for her child and herself. \"If this is what is considered to be living, then yes, I am living,\" she adds.

He also missed a Test in Pakistan last winter after tearing his hamstring in the summer and limped out of a match in New Zealand in December having repeated the injury. \"If he is not in the middle to make those decisions, to know when to back his bowlers, when to attack, that is a massive vacuum,\" Ramprakash said. \"If Ben Stokes plays these five Tests then I think England win and win quite comfortably.\" 'He'd have lit up like a Christmas tree' - McGrath on scans, Bazball & Australia Who are TMS pundits' Ashes players to watch? Stokes has been the focus of the hostilities from the Australian media since arriving in Perth, with one local paper describing him as \"England's Cocky Captain Complainer\". Stokes and some other England players were also pictured on the golf course on Monday - an apparent attempt to question the side's preparations. Stokes' county coach, Western Australian Ryan Campbell, criticised the headlines and questioned the logic in targeting Stokes before the series. \"I got a bit shirty about it,\" Durham coach Campbell said. \"I want WA to put on a good show. I don't want that stuff. \"Everyone wants to say something smart. A lot of it you have to take with a pinch of salt. \"There is two blokes I wouldn't have a crack at - that is Ben Stokes and Joe Root. \"They are the calmest and take it on board to give back in spades. Pick your targets a bit better.\" Stokes has already produced a number of famous Ashes moments, starting with a century in his second Test against Australia in Perth during the 2013-14 tour. The most famous was his extraordinarymatch-winning century at Headingleyin 2019 and spinner Jack Leach - his final batting partner that day - said he was inspired by Australia's aggression during that knock. \"[David] Warner had been going at him,\" Leach said. \"He said [at the end of day three] 'I am not walking off that pitch until we have won the game' and was really fired up. Obviously he ended up doing it.\" Leach added: \"[Root] does it in a quieter way. He is, deep down, pretty motivated for this. \"There has been a lot of chat about himnever scoring a hundred in Australiaso he is going in with a lot to prove.\""}

Speaking as she swore in her new cabinet, Samia warned that the violence could \"set the country back\". \"We mostly depend on loans from international creditors, but what happened eroded our global credibility,\" the 65-year-old president said. She was declared the winner of October's presidential poll with 98% of the vote, but the opposition - which was barred from contesting - denounced the election as a \"mockery of democracy\". Lazarus Chakwera, Malawi's former president and the Commonwealth envoy, is due to arrive in Tanzania to lead reconciliation efforts between the two sides. Hundreds may have died as security forces crushed the protests under cover of a five-day internet blackout after the 29 October elections, according to the opposition. The authorities are yet to release an official death toll. Gruesome images and videos of dead Tanzanians have circulated online following the disputed elections, in which key opposition leaders were jailed or disqualified. The violence was shocking for a nation that had cultivated an image of calm and order for nearly six decades. At least 240 people were charged with treason after the protests. Last week, President Samiaannounced an official investigation into the unrestand urged prosecutors to consider reducing or dropping charges for detained individuals who were not directly involved in the protests. Samia came into office in 2021 following the death of President John Magufuli - and was initially praised for easing political repression, but the political space has since narrowed. On Tuesday, she cautioned that her next term could bring economic challenges, noting that securing financial support from international banks may not be easy. \"In the first term, we used to get loans from outside due to our stability and the progress we made. But the stain we brought upon ourselves could now hinder that,\" she said. \"For this reason, we must focus on mobilising domestic resources and harnessing our God-given resources,\" Samia told her ministers. One new appointment to the 27-member cabinet is her daughter, Wanu Hafidh Ameir, who was named deputy education minister. Wanu's husband, Mohamed Mchengerwa, remains in cabinet taking up the post of health minister. Seven members of the previous cabinet have lost their positions. On Monday, Commonwealth Secretary-General Shirley Botchwey said Chakwera was to lead \"constructive dialogue\" during his four-day mission to Tanzania. He is set to hold consultations with government officials, political party leaders, civil society groups, religious and traditional leaders and diplomatic representatives.

Joseph O'Connor, from Liverpool, hijacked more than 130 accounts in July 2020, including those of Barack Obama, Joe Biden and Elon Musk. The 26-year-old fled to Spain where his mother lives before being arrested and extradited to the US for trial. He was sentenced to five years for cyber crimes but now must hand over a haul of crypto he gathered through various hacks and scams. O'Connor, who went by the alias PlugwalkJoe, carried out the so-called \"giveaway scam\" with other young men and teenagers - breaking into Twitter's internal systems and taking over high profile accounts. Three other hackers have been charged over the scam, with US teenager Graham Clark pleading guilty to his part in the deception in 2021. The hackers gained access to the accounts by first convincing a small number of Twitter employees to hand over their internal login details - which eventually granted them access to the social media site's administrative tools. They used social engineering tricks to get access to the powerful internal control panel at the site. Once inside the Twitter accounts of famous individuals, they pretended to be the celebrities and tweeted asking followers to send Bitcoin to various digital wallets promising to double their money. As a result of the fraud, an estimated 350 million Twitter users viewed suspicious tweets from official accounts of some of the platform's biggest users, including Apple, Uber, Kanye West and Bill Gates. Thousands were duped into believing that a crypto giveaway was real. Between 15 and 16 July 2020, 426 transfers were made to the scammers of various amounts from people hoping to double their money. A total of over 12.86 BTC was stolen which at the time was worth around $110,000 (£83,500). It is now worth $1.2m. The UK's Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said investigators believed more crypto linked to O'Connor was obtained through criminal hacks he carried out with other teenagers and young people he met whilst playing Call of Duty online. The CPS has recovered 42 Bitcoin and other digital currency in total from him. Adrian Foster, Chief Crown Prosecutor for the CPS Proceeds of Crime Division, said O'Connor \"targeted well known individuals and used their accounts to scam people out of their crypto assets and money\". \"Even when someone is not convicted in the UK, we are still able to ensure they do not benefit from their criminality,\" he said.

Australia have named their squad for the opening Ashes Test against England as they look to extend their grip on the urn into a second decade. Captain and pace bowler Pat Cummins will miss the first Test as he recovers from a back injury, with Scott Boland set to take his place in the team. Tasmania's Jake Weatherald has earned a maiden call-up and may open the batting. The series starts on 21 November, with the fifth and final Test beginning on 4 January. BBC Sport profiles each player, including the absent Cummins, and looks at their Test career and recent form. Australia Ashes squad - only one player under 30 How to follow the Ashes across the BBC Who are the players in England's Ashes squad? Age:38;Tests:84;Runs:6,053;Average:43.86;Centuries:16 Australia's top order has been problematic in recent times but Khawaja has been the one certainty for this series. The left-hander averages 44.23 in 35 innings against England, with four centuries. His average is 49.90 in home conditions and how he fares in the Ashes may go a long way to deciding the outcome. He averages 53.98 in Tests in 2025 so is in good touch. The 31-year-old has been called up to the squad for the first time, with Sam Konstas, Nathan McSweeney - both of whom made their debut last year - and Matt Renshaw left out. Chief selector George Bailey described Weatherald as \"really solid\" and said they like how he builds an innings and the rate he scores at. However, Bailey stopped short of confirming he would make his debut in Perth. Weatherald averages 37.62 in four Sheffield Shield matches this season, having finished last season as the top run-scorer and with an average of 50.33. Age:31;Tests:58;Runs:4,435;Average:46.19;Centuries:11 For quite a while it felt like Labuschagne would not be part of Australia's squad, but he forced his way back in thanks to a superb start to the domestic season. He has hit five centuries in all formats, including two in the Sheffield Shield, where he averages 67.00 in four innings. His role in the side may depend on the fitness of Cameron Green. If Green can bowl, Labuschagne is likely to bat at three, but he may have to open if Green plays as a specialist batter. Labuschagne was dropped for the Test series in West Indies in July after averaging 25.84 and failing to score a century in 15 Tests. The 31-year-old, who made his Ashes debut as Test cricket's first concussion sub in 2019, averages 40.64 in 14 Tests against England. Age:36;Tests:119;Runs:10,477;Average:56.02;Centuries:36 Smith is the glue in Australia's batting, particularly now he is back at four after a brief stint as an opener. He averages 56.01 against England and 59.70 across his career in Australia. He will captain the side in the first Test in Cummins' absence, but his form is sure to have a huge impact on the outcome of the series. Age:31;Tests:60;Runs:3,963;Average:41.71;Centuries:9 Head is the X-factor in Australia's batting line-up and is capable of taking the game away from England in an hour. The left-hander is short of form, though, with a top score of 31 in eight white-ball innings since the start of October. That resulted in him skipping the final two games of a T20 series against India to play in the last round of Sheffield Shield before the Ashes from 10 November. Head, 31, averages 39.56 in 13 Tests against England and 51.52 in home conditions over his career. Age:26;Tests:32;Runs:1,565;Average:34.02;Wickets:35;Average:35.31 Green was always going to be part of Australia's squad but his role in the side has been up for debate. Having played as a specialist batter because of back injuries, he has returned to bowling in domestic cricket in recent weeks. That opens up the possibility of Green being used as the all-rounder at six in Australia's side, with a batter at three. He averages 27.58 with the bat in eight Tests against England - down on a career average of 34.02 - and has taken 18 wickets. Age:31;Tests:7;Runs:381;Average:34.63;Wickets:8;Average:23.25 The 31-year-old made his Test debut against India last December and has been the all-rounder in the side since. However, the potential bowling return of Green and the form of Labuschagne may mean Webster finds himself out of the side. He made two hard-fought half-centuries in tricky conditions against West Indies, adding to one in the World Test Championship final against South Africa, so he has shown he can be a gritty character when needed. Age:34;Tests:43;Runs:2,010;Average:34.65;Centuries:2;Dismissals:177 Carey is an established part of Australia's side and there is very little pressure on his spot. The left-hander is capable of absorbing pressure or going through the gears with the bat depending on the situation. Careycontroversially stumped Jonny Bairstowin the 2023 Ashes at Lord's, so he has history with England. He averages 21.27 in 10 Tests against England, compared to his career average of 34.65 and 31.68 in home conditions. Age:30;Tests:3;Runs:119;Average:29.75;Centuries:0 Inglis, who was born in Leeds, has been Australia's spare middle-order batter in recent years and continues for the first Test. He is yet to play a Test at home but is a regular in their white-ball side and is an aggressive batter. He will also be the spare keeper if anything happens to Alex Carey. He averaged 72.60 in three Sheffield Shield games last year. Age:32;Tests:71;Wickets:309;Average:22.10;Best figures:6-23 Cummins will miss the opening Test in Perth but has ramped up his preparations with the aim of being available for the second game in Brisbane. He is fourth in the International Cricket Council's Test bowling rankings and has taken 91 wickets in 19 Ashes Test at an average of 24.10. Cummins averages 19.92 in home conditions throughout his career and Joe Root is the batter he has dismissed the most (11). Age:35;Tests:100;Wickets:402;Average:27.02;Best figures:6-9 Starc is a new-ball menace in all conditions, but particularly in day-night Tests. The left-armer has 81 wickets and averages 17.08 in 14 pink-ball Tests, so watch out for him in Brisbane. He has taken 97 wickets in 22 Ashes Tests at an average of 27.37, removing Ben Stokes nine times and Joe Root eight. Starc is handy with the bat too, averaging 20.19 against England, with 11 half-centuries. Age:34;Tests:76;Wickets:295;Average:24.21;Best figures:6-67 Hazlewood has been an integral part of a formidable trio alongside Cummins and Starc - whom he shares new-ball duties with - for several years. He has taken 76 wickets at an average of 25.97 in 18 Ashes Tests and averages 22.70 in home Tests over his career. He has removed Root 10 times - more than any other batter. He will miss at least the first Test after suffering a hamstring injury while playing in the Sheffield Shield. He missed three of the five Tests against India in Australia's most recent home summer any prolonged absence would impact their chances. Age:36;Tests:14;Wickets:62;Average:16.53;Best figures:6-7 Boland has been the spare seamer around Australia's squad since making his debut in the 2021 Ashes. He is a more than dependable replacement and is set to feature in the first Test in Cummins' absence. Boland has taken 20 wickets in five Tests against England, averaging 20.15, while across his whole Test career he averages a ridiculous 12.63 in home conditions. However, England attacked him in the 2023 series on home soil, when he averaged 48. Expect the same approach this time round. Age:37;Tests:139;Wickets:562;Average:30.14;Best figures:8-50 Off-spinner Lyon is the seventh-most prolific bowler in Test history and needs only two wickets to climb above compatriot Glenn McGrath into sixth. Pitches in Australia have produced more movement in recent years, so Lyon's influence has decreased slightly, as shown by his nine wickets at 36.88 apiece against India last year. There is a chance he may not make the team in some Ashes Tests, but he has often been England's nemesis, taking 110 wickets in 30 Tests at 29.41. Lyon was injured in the 2023 Ashes and famously hobbled out to bat at Lord's, but he will be keen to write some more positive memories in what is likely to be his last series against England. Abbott has been a pretty regular part of Australia's white-ball teams in recent years but has not featured in Tests. He has been part of squads but has been unable to break up the formidable Cummins-Hazlewood-Starc trio. He took one wicket in his Sheffield Shield game this season but is expected to play in the round of matches that start on 10 November. He claimed 19 wickets at an average of 21.94 last season. He averages 24.62 with the bat in first-class cricket so would add batting depth to Australia if called upon. He isn't an option for the opening Test though after suffering a hamstring injury. Doggett will be the other spare seamer in the squad after impressing in Sheffield Shield cricket in recent years. He claimed match figures of 7-86 in his only outing this season, having taken 33 wickets at 24.15 apiece last season. He had a three-game spell with Durham this summer, taking nine wickets in three matches at 33.44. Age:35;Tests:2;Wickets:7;Average:16.71;Best figures:3-22 Neser was added to the squad after injuries to Hazlewood and Abbott. He got the call over Fergus O'Neill who has impressed in Shield cricket. Neser has taken 14 wickets at an average of 24.28 in Australia's red-ball competition this season. He may be behind Doggett in the pecking order now but he's a solid option if Australia decide to go that way. All ages and stats correct as of 15 November.

Few, if any, may notice the installation. But the train they are on is drawing power from it. \"On a sunny afternoon, if you are catching a train through Aldershot, a little bit of the energy for that train will come from those solar panels,\" says Leo Murray, co-founder and chief executive of Riding Sunbeams, a start-up aiming to use renewable energy resources for rail electrification projects. Riding Sunbeamsbuilt the Aldershot array in 2019. It's small in scale at just 40 kilowatts – equivalent to roughly 10 of the rooftop solar arrays you would find on a typical British home. But it demonstrates how renewables can feed directly in to the railways. Not only that, Mr Murray says it is currently the only solar array in the country that delivers power directly to rail to move trains. \"If you are a railway, this is the cheapest electricity you can buy,\" he adds. Around the country, and the world, many trains still run on diesel – a fossil fuel. To go electric, rail operators have traditionally had two options: electrified rail, or overhead lines that that trains connect to witharm-like pantographson their roofs. Installing either of these systems can be expensive and technically challenging. But engineers are working on new ways of implementing such technologies and completely different alternatives are also emerging, which could speed up electrification projects. A key barrier to electrification is often the limitations of the local electricity grid –it's hard to get accessto a big connection for powering your trains. \"That problem has only become much, much worse,\" says Mr Murray. This is why he views solar panels as so useful in enabling railway electrification projects. Mr Murray says that, after the Aldershot project, he had hoped Riding Sunbeams would go on to build a full-scale commercial pilot. But funding problems got in the way. Now, however, Network Rail, which owns and maintains railway infrastructure in Great Britain,is seeking suppliersfor rail-side renewables projects. \"This is the big one,\" says Mr Murray, explaining that his business is planning to bid for a contract. New projects bring new complexities, however. At Aldershot, the track was already electrified – it was a case of plugging solar panels in to that existing system. But for trains that are switching off diesel and moving over to overhead lines, leveraging solar is harder. This is because solar panels produce direct current (DC) electricity whereas overhead lines use alternating current (AC). Efforts are underway in England to developa new converter devicethat could solve this problem, though. Separately, Colton Junction between Leeds and York, the fastest railway junction in the UK – where trains speed through at up to 125mph – was electrified recently with the help of software developed at the University of Huddersfield. The software makes a 3D model of the overhead line system, allowing engineers to plan its construction in minute detail – lowering costs by removing the need for certain forms of traditional testing and evaluation. \"Everything was specified in the software in terms of measurements,\" says João Pombo, associate director of the university's Institute of Railway Research. \"All the trains are running at maximum speed at that junction since August.\" But there are completely different ideas for electrification out there. Polish start-up Nevomo has developed an electromagnetic propulsion system.It's retrofittedonto existing track by fitting a thick aluminium cable into an enclosure that runs between the rails. This generates a magnetic field strong enough to propel freight wagons fitted with magnets. \"We eliminate locomotives completely,\" says Ben Paczek, founder and chief executive. \"Each wagon becomes independent. They can also operate in groups.\" A key benefit of the technology, says Mr Paczek, is that it allows operators to bring freight wagons to a stop very quickly – and, as a consequence, that means they could, in principle, safely put lots of independently moving wagons relatively close together on one stretch of rail, increasing the density of freight transportation in a particular area. Nevomo hopes to launch working implementations of its technology at a steel plant in Bremen, Germany, and at a port in India next year. These will be relatively small in scale, each covering track distances of less than 1km (0.6 miles). But Mr Paczek hopes to see bigger installations in the future. \"In a quite conservative environment like rail, we need to demonstrate it properly first.\" It would be possible to automate the motion of electromagnetically-propelled wagons, he adds – though initially they will be controlled remotely by human operators. In the US, Parallel Systems is also working on electrifying individual freight wagons so that they can move independently around a rail network – but in a very different way, with batteries. The firm's wagons would have a range of 800km, says co-founder and chief executive Matt Soule. He describes it like moving packets around a distribution centre – \"atomised freight\", and quite unlike traditional locomotive-pulled freight trains that can bemore than 2km long. \"We're focused on doing the shorter stuff that they're not doing,\" says Mr Soule. He adds that he does not aim to replace freight locomotives, but rather to offer a rail-based delivery service that could compete with trucking. \"If we simply grab 10% of the trucking market, we've doubled the rail industry,\" he says. Stuart Hillmansen at the University of Birmingham, who has worked with Riding Sunbeams in the past, says organising the movement of individual freight trains on an existing rail network could be \"quite challenging – certainly on [British] railways\". But he says that new technologies are helping to facilitate electrification – and that electrified trains in general are now the \"go-to\" option for new railways. \"All of these technologies are physically feasible and can work, the thing is managing the business case,\" he says."}

The decision hands a defeat to the Federal Trade Commission, the US antitrust watchdog, which sued Meta in 2020 claiming the company secured a monopoly in social media by purchasing its rivals. \"The Court ultimately concludes that the agency has not carried its burden: Meta holds no monopoly in the relevant market,\" wrote Judge James Boasberg on Tuesday. The company hailed the decision in a statement provided to the BBC, saying it \"recognizes that Meta faces fierce competition.\" In April, Judge Boasberg presided over a lengthy bench trial that featured testimony from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and former Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg who argued that TikTok and YouTube had shaken up the social media landscape. In his decision, Judge Boasberg noted that the FTC reviewed and approved of Meta's 2012 acquisition of Instagram and the 2014 acquisition of WhatsApp. The agency had argued the company overpaid when it purchased Instagram for $1 billion and WhatsApp for $19 billion. Judge Boasberg described a constantly changing social media landscape, \"with apps surging and receding, chasing one craze and moving on from others, and adding new features with each passing year. Even if Meta enjoyed monopoly power in the past, he said the FTC failed to show \"that it continues to hold such power now\" as Meta's market share \"seems to be shrinking.\" In a statement to the BBC, the FTC indicated it wasn't certain whether it plans to appeal. \"We are deeply disappointed in this decision,\" said Joe Simonson, director of Public Affairs at the FTC, who added the agency was reviewing all of its options. Simonson also told the BBC that \"the deck was always stacked against us with Judge Boasberg,\" who hasclashedmultiple times with the Trump administration and is facing an effort by congressional Republicans to have him impeached. The BBC has asked Judge Boasberg for comment. With its victory on Tuesday, Meta avoids a potential break-up of the company which could have included spinning off Instagram and WhatsApp. \"Our products are beneficial for people and businesses and exemplify American innovation and economic growth,\" a Meta spokesperson told the BBC on Tuesday. \"We look forward to continuing to partner with the Administration and to invest in America.\" The decision comes after the Department of Justice won two prior antitrust cases against Google - one alleging a monopoly in online search and the other in advertising technology. But earlier this year, another district judge in Washington presiding over the online search case declined to force Google to spinoff its Chrome browser, a step the justice department had suggested was necessary to end the tech giant's search monopoly. Against that backdrop, Tuesday's ruling against the FTC \"does feel like a change in momentum,\" said Rebecca Haw Allensworth, an antitrust law professor at Vanderbilt Law School. \"I think that's going to influence the likelihood of more cases like this being brought.\" But, Allensworth added, the ruling doesn't indicate that the government's efforts to crack down on antitrust behaviour are failing. Many legal observers say that the FTC case against Meta was challenging from the start. The case \"was always a difficult one, particularly given how quickly we have seen changes in the social networking market in recent years,\" said Laura Phillips-Sawyer, a professor at the University of Georgia School of Law. Still, she said, the case revealed \"a series of statements by Zuckerberg at the time of those acquisitions that looked like a desire to squelch a nascent threat to Facebook's dominance\". Meta's legal entanglements aren't over. Mr Zuckerberg has been ordered to testify in a landmark trial over the impact of social media on young people. Last month, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Carolyn Kuhl rejected Meta's argument that an in-person appearance in January was unnecessary. Instagram head Adam Mosseri is also slated to testify at the trial, which stems from accusations that Meta and other social media companies make their apps addictive to young people despite being aware of mental health risks.

It feels as if you lost a big part of your body or your soul.\" He was speaking to us from a displaced persons camp in Tawila some 70km (43 miles) to the west of el-Fasher, the regional hub which was taken over by paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in the last week of October after an 18-month siege. The RSF has been fighting the Sudanese army since April 2023, when a power struggle between their leaders erupted into a civil war. The alleged killings of at least 460 patients and their companions at the Saudi Hospitalwere one of the most shocking among widespread accounts of atrocities- some of them filmed by RSF fighters and posted to social media. In a statement of condemnation, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it was \"appalled and deeply shocked\" by the reported shootings, and by the abductions of six health workers - four doctors, a nurse and a pharmacist. The RSF has dismissed the accusations as disinformation, declaring that all of el-Fasher's hospitals had been abandoned. It disputed the claims by filming a video inside the hospital grounds showing female volunteers tending to patients. A freelancer based in Tawila gathered interviews for the BBC. Mr Ahmed told him he had carried on working at Saudi Hospital since the beginning of the war, despite regular shelling by artillery, tanks and drones - which destroyed parts of the buildings and injured doctors and nurses as well as patients. Medical staff used to share what little food was available as the RSF blockade tightened, he said, sometimes working without breakfast or lunch. Most of them fled when the paramilitary fighters launched their final assault. \"The shelling started around six in the morning,\" Mr Ahmed said. \"All civilians and soldiers headed out towards the southern side. There was a state of terror, and as we walked, drones were bombing us. And heavy artillery too - I saw many people die on the spot, there was no-one who could save them.\" Mr Ahmed said some of the fleeing medical workers arrived with him in Tawila, but many were detained in locations north-west of the city, naming the Garni area, the villages of Turra and Hilla al-Sheikh and the town of Korma. Some were transferred to Nyala, he said, the RSF's de facto capital in South Darfur. \"This is the information I received from colleagues we know,\" he told the BBC, saying that he later heard medical staff who remained at the hospital were executed. Mr Ahmed also lost much of his family: a sister and two brothers were killed that day, and his parents are missing. \"I am very worried about the fate of the people inside el-Fasher,\" he added. \"They may be killed. And they may be used as human shields against the [Sudanese air force] airstrikes.\" Accounts of the alleged hospital massacre were reported by two Sudanese doctors' groups, citing sources on the ground, and an el-Fasher activist network. Yale University's Humanitarian Research Lab said satellite imagery corroborated the reports, apparently showing blood on the ground and white grouped objects that looked like bodies in the hospital compound. In a satellite image from 1 November, the white objects are seen being placed at an area that had been dug within the compound of the hospital. In a subsequent one, taken on 6 November, these objects are seen charred and with smoke still rising from the area. BBC Verify has authenticated footage filmed at the nearby University of El-Fasher's Faculty of Medical Laboratory Sciences: it shows bodies lying on the floor and an RSF fighter shooting one of the men still alive. A spokesman for the Sudan Doctors Network, Dr Mohamed Elsheikh, told the BBC this building was being used as an extension to the Saudi hospital for wards and patients. He went on to explain that the RSF had been demanding ransoms for the release of the abducted health workers. \"The six kidnapped doctors or medical staff, one of them, his family, managed to pay the ransom equivalent to $30,000 [£23,000], and he arrived safely to Tawila town,\" said Dr Elsheikh, now working for the NHS in the UK. \"The other was executed,\" he added, saying the group has no information on the fate of the remaining four. Back in Tawila, Mohamed Abdu-Teia, who had been a patient at the Saudi Hospital when the RSF closed in, can do little else but lie on the ground with his leg in a tattered cast. It was broken in a shelling attack, he tells the BBC, but he managed to flee the city on foot the morning of the final RSF assault. Like many other men suspected of being soldiers, Mr Abdu-Teia was stopped at the Garni checkpoint and interrogated, he says. The two men with him were taken, but the RSF let him go. \"They didn't beat me, but they questioned me a lot, because of my injury, I think. They said: 'We know you are a soldier, but you're finished - you will die on the road. So just go.\" Mr Abdu-Teia says the RSF brought some medicine to Garni but \"the injuries were too many - two or three people died every hour. \"The same day we arrived, vehicles came and took people to unknown places. Any young man who looked physically OK was taken.\" He managed to get a lift to Tawila from \"people who had cars\". They charged passengers 500,000 Sudanese pounds ($830, £630) and turned on wi-fi hotspots so they could call their families to transfer money, he said. \"We left with them - we had nothing, not even plans.\" Many children arrived at the Tawila camps without parents. Fifteen-year-old Eman was one of them. Her father was killed in a drone strike in el-Fasher, she told the BBC, and her mother and brother were detained by the RSF as they fled. \"Whoever did not die, [the RSF] ran them over with vehicles,\" she said. \"They took our belongings and told us all of you are soldiers. They beat my brother and choked him with a chain. \"They wanted to beat my mother. She told us: 'Go, I will come to you.' We got into a vehicle and left. They did not allow my brother to get into the vehicle. We left them behind.\" Eman escaped but saw other girls and women who did not. \"They took some women. They took them in their vehicles and stabbed some of them with knives. Some were taken while their mothers couldn't do anything.\" Female survivors have told horrific stories of gang rapes and the abduction of young girls. Another teenager on her own, 14-year-old Samar, said she had lost her mother in the chaos at the Garni checkpoint, and her father was arrested. She was told he was taken to the Children's Hospital in el-Fasher. That building had reportedly been serving as an RSF detention centre, and it is where the Yale researchers also said satellite images showed evidence of killings: apparent clusters of bodies as well as earth excavations that could have been a mass grave. The RSF has issued videos to counter these allegations, declaring that the Children's Hospital in el-Fasher is ready to receive patients. One shows a man dressed in a blazer standing outside its gate with a group of what appear to be doctors in hospital scrubs. \"These medical personnel and cadres, they are not hostages,\" the man in the blazer says. \"We are not taking them as war hostages. They are free. They are free to practise medicine.\" Another man in the video, who introduces himself as Dr Ishaq Abdul Mahmoud, associate professor of paediatrics and child health at el-Fasher University, says: \"We are here to help any person in need of medical service. \"We are out of politics. Whether soldiers or [civilians] we are ready to help them.\" Dr Elsheikh of the Sudan Doctors Network dismisses the RSF videos as propaganda. And Mr Ahmed, the Saudi Hospital laboratory technician in Tawila, knows what he has seen, and he has seen too much. \"I do not have any hope of returning to el-Fasher,\" he says. \"After everything that happened and everything I saw. Even if there was a small hope, I remember what happened in front of me.\" Mohamed Zakaria is a freelance journalist from Darfur based in Kampala Additional reporting by BBC Verify's Peter Mwai Go toBBCAfrica.comfor more news from the African continent.

Measurescame into force in Julyas part of the Online Safety Act, meaning online and social media companies are now legally responsible for keeping children and young people safe online. The experiment, in collaboration with BBC Morning Live, used the same profiles and repeated the same exercise asa May investigation. Online safety expert David Wright CBE said it was \"really concerning\" but added \"in large part it's going to take time\" for change to happen. \"It just means that everyone still has to remain vigilant,\" added Mr Wright, who is CEO of the charity SWGfl and director at the UK Safer Internet Centre. TikTok and YouTube said they had safety protections in place for young users. In Spring, we set up six fictional social media profiles; three boys and three girls, all aged from 13 to 15. The boys used TikTok and YouTube and the girls used Instagram and TikTok. The fake profiles were scrolled for 10 minutes per platform every day for a week. On TikTok and YouTube the accounts were quickly served concerning posts. One profile was also guided to sexually suggestive content on Instagram. After the Online Safety Act came into effect, the exercise was repeated, this time in collaboration withBBC's Morning Live programme, sharing our findings with presenter Zara McDermott. We found there had been some improvements, especially on Instagram, which didn't show any potentially harmful content whatsoever this time. Instagram's Teen Accounts are now guided by PG-13 movie ratings to help protect under-18s. However, on TikTok, the girls were still exposed to worrying content, mostly on the profile of 15-year-old Maya, who was repeatedly shown posts about bullying, children who had taken their own lives, people who were terminally ill and stories of women and children who had been violently abused by men. While one or two posts like this might have gone unnoticed, the volume of them created a depressing sequence during a short 10-minute scroll. The profile of Sophie, 15, saw some of this material but far less, and Aisha, 13, did not see much of concern. The boys were not shown any content that was particularly concerning on TikTok, and two of the three YouTube profiles were similarly clear. However, 15-year-old Harry's YouTube feed showed videos reviewing knives, guns and crossbows. Also - for the first time in our research - the platform displayed footage of animals being shot dead. As before, the more worrying material came out of the blue and was seemingly at odds with other content in the profile's Youtube Shorts feed, with videos on subjects such a football and gaming coming before and after it. After watching the videos we recorded during our investigation, Emma Motherwell from the children's charity NSPCC said: \"More needs to be done.\" She added companies should be \"integrating that safety by design\". According to TikTok, its teen accounts include more than 50 safety and privacy settings, including content restrictions and a 60-minute screen limit. It says it bans the vast majority of content classed as harmful to children, restricting mature material to verified over-18s. YouTube said it takes its responsibility for younger viewers seriously, having expanded its protections for teens, including safeguards on content recommendations. A spokesperson added: \"We generally welcome research on our systems, but it's difficult to draw broad conclusions based on these test accounts, which may not be consistent with the behaviour of real people.\" Ms Motherwell advised parents to \"create that opportunity for really open, non-judgemental conversations\" with their children. \"That opens up the opportunity for them to speak up if they come across content that has had an impact on then,\" she added. She also suggested families use parental controls and block certain sites. Mr Wright agreed parents still need to stay across what their children are consuming. \"Just have a voyage with your children through their particular device and the sorts of content, the sorts of apps, the sorts of services they're using. \"Please don't just rely that we've now got these magical codes [Online Safety Act codes of practice] that it's all going to be okay.\" He said signs there had been changes, such as with Instagram, were encouraging, \"and I would like to think that's a result of the codes being implemented\". But he said the ruling did not mean \"everything gets changed on a particular day\", adding: \"We'll see this kind of shift over time.\" Mr Wright said there would always be room for improvement because \"this is not a binary thing that we're necessarily dealing with\", and that it was now up to Ofcom to continue investigating and enforcing the law.

BBC journalists in the East of England and London attended various county courts  as mortgage-holders and renters appeared in front of judges. They included a couple now £13,000 in arrears on a home they bought, and a woman who faced the repossession of a house she left following a marriage breakdown 15 years earlier. The BBC also heard landlords were grappling with financial pressures - while the body representing lenders said seeking to repossess a home was \"always a last resort\". Data obtained by the BBC's investigations team showed mortgage repossession orders in England and Wales reached 10,853 in 2024-5 - the highest number in five years. Andrew Goodwin, senior economist at Oxford Economics, said rising unemployment and interest rates had been contributing factors in recent years. Reporters were sent to courts in Northampton, Peterborough and Norwich in the East, as well as Stratford, Wandsworth and Croydon courts in London to hear cases and the pressures facing mortgage-holders and tenants. The courts heard matters concerning both mortgage and rental repossessions. In Croydon, a former management consultant said he and his wife both lost their jobs in 2024, leaving them in mortgage arrears. The prospect of his son losing his childhood home had hit hard, adding it was \"the perfect place for us\". They now haveuntil Marchto pay the arrears. In Stratford, a tearful woman who had not lived in her property for15 years after her marriage broke downhad the home with £87,000 in mortgage arrears repossessed. Other stories heard throughout the day included: It was not just those facing the loss of their homes sharing their challenges. Case workers and solicitors across the courts revealed theywere being \"overrun\"with requests for help. \"When I began my career, up until a few years ago, I would think to myself 'that person won't actually end up homeless',\" said Angus King, a housing solicitor from Southwark Law Centre. \"I knew we would find some way to keep them from it, but now that simply isn't the case.\" Billy Harding, a Southwark Law Centre housing case worker assisting at Wandsworth County Court on Wednesday, said people were turning up \"at crisis point\". Renter loses home as judge rejects 'last chance': BBC reports from repossession courts in England The BBC found that across England the number of people asking their council for help to prevent becoming homeless was increasing. Figures from 244 councils that responded to Freedom of Information requests showed three-quarters of them reported a rise. For 2024/25, Broxbourne in Hertfordshire had the highest rate, where 95 out of 100,000 people were seeking help. Similarly bailiff repossessionswere rising againafter a dip during the Covid-19 pandemic. One landlord attending Norwich County Court also told of how anxious she was about coming to court to try to collect £2,200 in unpaid rent. She told the judge the tenant, a carpenter, had offered to repair the windows of the property in lieu of rent. \"That was OK, but he never got back to me about that,\" she said. Speaking on behalf of landlords in a separate court, one solicitor said the landlords also had bills to pay or financial issues themselves and couldn't be expected to subsidise their tenants. Karina Hutchins, of UK Finance - which represents the banking industry - said seeking to repossess a home is \"always a last resort\" for lenders.

In September, Eminem – whose real name is Marshall B Mathers III – filed a petition to the US Patent and Trademark Office, calling for it to cancel a trademark that was granted to the company. US law requires the companyto respond to the petition by next week. The 53-year-old rapper's lawyers accused the Sydney-based brand of creating a \"false association\" with Eminem. Swim Shady told the BBC in a statement that it would \"defend our valuable intellectual property\". The company's name was registered in September 2023, according to Australia's business regulator, having originally launching under the name Slim Shade. It officially launched in 2024. The brand sells portable beach umbrellas, swim bags and other beach accessories. Earlier this year, the brand filed a trademark in the US for the term \"Swim Shady\", which was granted. Shortly afterwards, Eminem's team filed a petition to cancel the trademark. Eminem has also filed an opposition to the brand's name in Australia. \"Swim Shady is a grass roots Australian company that was born out of a desire to produce stylish and effective sun shades and other items to protect from the harsh Australian sun,\" the company said, adding that it could not comment further due to the ongoing legal case. Court documents show Eminem trademarked the name Slim Shady in the US in 1999 with the release of the eponymous album. However, he only filed a trademark for the Slim Shady name in Australia in January 2025. Eminem shot into fame in 2000 with the release of his hit single The Real Slim Shady, which earned him a Grammy for best rap solo performance. His lawyers said the name has become \"distinctive and famous\" and exclusively associated with his rap career. Sydney intellectual property legal specialist firm Meyer West IP is listed as Swim Shady's legal representative. Last year, an Australian court overturned an earlier ruling thatUS pop star Katy Perry infringed on the trademark of Australian designer Katie Perry. The Australian designer sold clothes under her birth name and had accused the California Girls singer of trademark infringement when she sold merchandise during her 2014 Australian tour. Katie Perry compared the legal clash at the time to a David and Goliath showdown."}

In one case, stores targeted by a thief waited up to 10 months for a shoplifter to be sentenced, despite retail workers piecing together her identity without help from the police. Chelsea Strange, 33, went on a three-week crime spree stealing £2,000 worth of Jellycat soft toys from four different stores across the south west of England and one in Wales -which she later sold on Vinted. Figures obtained by the BBC show the average time it takes for a shoplifting case to be dealt with from offence to completion in a magistrates' court in England and Wales has risen by more than 80% in the last 10 years – from 32 days in 2014 to 59 days in 2024. Trade bodies representing retailers have said many stores have been left frustrated with the way shoplifters are dealt with. They say the time taken reduces shopkeepers' faith in the justice system - making them feel there's no point in reporting crimes. \"The delays in bringing perpetrators to court really does add insult to injury,\" said Andrew Goodacre, chief executive of the British Independent Retailers Association. \"It is no surprise many small shop owners simply do not bother reporting the crime in the first place. In their minds it makes no difference.\" The BBC has looked at a series of shoplifting cases which highlight how shops have been left waiting months for thieves to be brought to justice. We followed the Jellycat shoplifting case since December 2024, when we reported how a garden centre owner in Bridport, Dorset, hadmanaged to piece together the thief's identity by scouring resale websites, deciphering her car's personalised number plate, and finding her Facebook profile. Austins department store in Newton Abbot, Devon, was also targeted by Strange on three separate occasions – and staff said they too were able to figure out who she was. Head of security Tom Hirst described the time taken to deal with shoplifters as \"unacceptable\" and said the criminal justice system is \"too easy on them\". \"You're better off shoplifting than going to work, that's my honest view,\" he added. \"Every time someone comes in and steals something, that cost gets passed on… it puts the price up so we're all paying.\" In July, Strange, from Felton, Bristol, was sentenced to a 12-month community order at Newton Abbot Magistrates Court after admitting stealing from five shops across Devon, Somerset, Dorset and South Wales in September and October last year. She was also ordered to pay nearly £1,800 in compensation. Strange's defence team said the offences were out of character and would not have taken place if it had not been for her poor mental health. ​​Fiona Malone, who runs a Post Office in Tenby, Pembrokeshire, also told the BBC she had to wait five months for a shoplifter who stole from her store to face sentencing – despite catching the thief red-handed. The shopkeeper confronted Natalie Lintern after security cameras captured her stealing pre-mixed vodka cans, sandwiches and cake from the store in August last year. Mrs Malone chased the 36-year-old down the street and got the stolen items back before reporting it to the police. \"The whole criminal justice system is too slow, it's bureaucratic,\" she told the BBC. \"We need to deal with these people and deal with them quickly and think about alternative punishments to stop them doing it in the first place.\" In January, Lintern, from Pembroke, Pembrokeshire, was given a 12-month community order after pleading guilty to stealing from Tenby Post Office and four other stores between April and September 2024. But the sentence did not stop her from shoplifting again. Six months later, she was back in court again where she admitted stealing from a service station in May. She was given six weeks in jail, suspended for 12 months. \"What we're doing as a society, it's not working,\" said Mrs Malone. \"It's like whatever punishment she got it was almost like 'Oh never mind I'll just go out and do it again'.\" The most serious shop thefts can end up being heard at crown court where figures show the average time from the offence to cases being completed has increased from 111 days in 2016 to 128 days in 2024. Shoplifter Bianca Mirica appeared in crown court after stealing more than £105,000 worth of goods from high street chain Boots between December 2023 and May 2024. The 20-year-old, from Tottenham, London, was part of a shoplifting gang and would clear shelves of cosmetics and perfumes while another member of her team acted as look-out, according to police. It took 14 months from her last theft before she was sentenced to 32 months in a young offenders' institution, after pleading guilty to 18 charges of theft. Shoplifting has increased by 13% in the last year with 529,994 shoplifting offences recorded by police in England and Wales up to June 2025, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). However, the ONS said there are signs that increasing rates of shops thefts being reported are now slowing. The crime adds an estimated £133 onto the cost of an average UK household's shopping bill each year, according to the Centre for Retail Research. The government told the BBC it understood the \"devastating impact\" of shop theft on retailers and it was clear many cases were taking too long to be resolved, adding: \"Justice delayed is justice denied.\" It said it is backing the courts with record funding and consideringrecommendations for long term structural reformof the system. The National Police Chiefs Council said it had strengthened its relationship with retailers and improved information sharing in the last two years - which had resulted in a number of offenders being brought to justice. Assistant Chief Constable Alex Goss said it planned to bring together police, shops and the security industry to make best use of their resources and \"turn the tide on the volume of offending blighting our communities\"."}

But in its UK and Ireland stores, like-for-like sales - a key metric in the retail industry - weredown 3.1%in the year to September, which it attributed to a \"weak\" consumer environment and fewer people buying winter clothes during last year's mild autumn. As online stores like Shein and Vinted continue to attract young shoppers, does Primark face a fight to remain relevant - or is it just fine? \"While the UK clothing market is seeing subdued growth, Primark has significantly underperformed the overall market,\" says Tamara Sender-Ceron, an associate director at market-research agency Mintel, adding that it faces \"increased competition\". Some shoppers point out that online marketplaces like Shein and Temu have even lower prices, a huge range of products, and - crucially - home delivery, something Primark lacks. At Primark's biggest London store on Oxford Street, which BBC News visited this week, Serena Milius has just popped in with her 12-year-old daughter to look at pyjamas, socks and the new Stranger Things range. Serena used to do most of her shopping at Primark - until Shein took over. \"Shein's our main thing,\" the 34-year-old finance manager from Tooting, south-west London, says. She says her wardrobe is now 90% Shein, and goes to Primark for \"little bits and bobs\" like flipflops, candles, socks and cosmetics dupes. Others tell the BBC they'd rather splash out on better-quality products. This includes Martha, a 23-year-old student in Leeds, who only shops at Primark for basics like T-shirts, socks, underwear and cotton buds. For other items, she turns to Weekday, Zara and independent shops. \"I like to buy more expensive items that I'm going to wear over the years,\" she tells the BBC as she browses clothes in a Primark store with her mum. Primark repeatedly faces criticism for its \"fast fashion\" approach with shoppers saying products they buy from there aren't hard-wearing. \"It's not always a lasting item,\" Martha adds. However Primark's product longevity lead, Vicki Swain, said that they have developed a Durability Framework that would help people get more wear from their purchases - no matter how much they can afford to spend. \"We've been investing in making our clothes more durable and also making them with more sustainable materials,\" she toldBBC Radio 4's You and Yours programme. The store was busy when the BBC visited on a late Wednesday afternoon, with mainly female shoppers browsing alone or in pairs. Some said they'd gone out of their way to visit, others popping in after finding themselves in the area. Some say they're deterred by Primark's huge, sprawling stores which can sometimes get very busy. \"I do not enjoy shopping in a Primark,\" says Abbi Lily, a 24-year-old content creator from near Bournemouth. She describes the experience as \"very overwhelming\" and \"overstimulating\" and says it can be \"impossible\" to find things. She used to buy most of her clothes from Primark, but feels it isn't as cheap as it used to be. \"They just don't have the bargains as much anymore,\" she says, echoing comments some other shoppers made to the BBC. Though Abbi sometimes shops at Shein, she's trying to become more \"intentional\" with her shopping and buy more second-hand items, including through Vinted and Depop. A Primark spokesperson told BBC News that 85% of its products were £10 or under, and said it \"continually benchmarks\" its prices against competitors. Shein uses AI to identify trends and launch \"thousands of new styles daily\", says Ms Sender-Ceron at Mintel. According to a survey by Mintel in May, 46% of UK women aged 16 to 34 had bought fashion items from Shein in the last 12 months. It has held pop-up shops in London and this week opened itsfirst permanent physical shopin a department store in Paris, with long queues of people waiting to get their hands on cut-price garments. \"You can buy anything from Shein,\" said one shopper waiting in the French capital to visit on its opening day. \"It's such a cool thing for people my age who are struggling in this economy.\" But as shoppers queued to get into the store, protesters screamed \"Shame!\" at them. The critics were calling for a boycott of the brand because of the environmental impact of fast fashion and working conditions in its factories. Just over an hour after the new store opened,the French government also confirmed it was initiating proceedings to suspend Shein's website, after prosecutors said they were investigating the company over childlike sex dolls found on its website. Paris prosecutors are also investigating three other platforms - Temu, AliExpress and Wish. Allegations surrounding the sale of childlike sex dolls on Shein first came to light from France's anti-fraud office. Shein has promised to co-operate fully. In a statement, the retailer said it had already temporarily suspended listings from independent third-party vendors. With Shein specialising in delivering clothes to your door, Primark does offer click-and-collect services in its nearly 200 UK stores - but not deliveries. Some high-street retailers have been struggling in the UK, but Primark has largely bucked the trend - it's closing a store in Dartford, Kent, next year, which reports say will be its first store closure in a decade. It also opened dedicated Primark Home stores in Belfast and Manchester. Primark relies on its customers shopping in bulk, Mr Stevenson says. \"You might be going in for one thing, but you end up buying seven things that you hadn't really thought about,\" he says. This doesn't happen as much with online shopping, he says. Would Primark's sales be boosted if it did offer delivery? Mr Stevenson is sceptical, saying \"it doesn't feel like they're losing out by not doing that\", but that it could be an option in future. \"If you wanted to buy a couple of things from Primark for £5 each, are you going to pay 50% of that in delivery charge?\" he asks. \"Because buying £10 of stuff is going to cost me £5 to get it tomorrow.\" Primark's spokesperson said that its online model was a \"deliberate choice to streamline operations and pass the savings directly to customers\". Though Primark's like-for-like sales in the UK and Ireland are down, \"I absolutely don't think they're doing badly,\" says Mr Stevenson, the Peel Hunt analyst. Its UK and Ireland market share has grown, according to data from market-research company Kantar. And its total sales globally in the year to September were up 1% compared to the previous year as it opened more stores in Europe and the US. For some shoppers, Primark will always have a hold on them. \"I absolutely love Primark,\" says Khloe Lightholder, a 34-year-old childcare worker from Essex. She says Primark is \"actually quite good quality for the price\" and she visits every few months for a couple of hours, usually spending £200 or more on shoes, bags, perfume and homeware. She sets herself a monthly budget, \"but every time I go to Primark that budget is out of the window\". How much of a threat Shein and other budget retailers pose is an ongoing challenge, but it doesn't feel like Primark's brown shopping bags will disappear from our high streets any time soon."}

The French consumer watchdog first raised concernsat the weekend over the description and categorisation of the dolls, saying it left \"little doubt as to the child pornography nature of the content.\" The company said on Monday that it had permanently banned \"all seller accounts linked to illegal or non-compliant sex-doll products\" and will tighten controls across its global platform. Shein also said it had temporarily removed its adult products category as a precaution. Every listing and image related to the sex dolls has been removed from its platform, Shein confirmed, adding that it would conduct a thorough review and planned to set stricter controls on sellers. \"The company has also strengthened its keyword blacklist to further prevent attempted circumvention of product listing restrictions by sellers,\" the company said. Executive chairman Donald Tang said: \"The fight against child exploitation is non-negotiable for Shein. These were marketplace listings from third-party sellers - but I take this personally.\" \"We are tracing the source and will take swift, decisive action against those responsible.\" In a statement, the Paris prosecutor's office said it had received reports by France's Directorate General for Competition, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control (DGCCRF) that sex dolls resembling children were on sale on Shein and online retail platform AliExpress. The DGCCRF also said that the two companies as well as Temu and Wish were being investigated in relation to the \"dissemination of violent, pornographic, or undignified messages accessible to a minor.\" The prosecutor's office said it had referred the investigation to the OFMIN, a French agency tasked with preventing violence against minors. The DGCCRF initially raised concerns about the dolls on Saturday. In response, Shein said it had removed the listings for childlike sex dolls as soon as it became aware of the issue and began an investigation over how the products were able to be offered for sales on its platform. France's finance minister threatened to ban the Singapore-based retailer from the country if it continued to sell the products - days before the company was due to open its first permanent outlet in Paris.

The para-cyclist, who clinched her country's first gold medal at the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games, died on Sunday at her home in Adelaide after a \"sudden medical episode\", said AusCycling, the sport's national governing body. Greco's family is \"devastated by her loss, [but] incredibly proud of the person she was and the way she represented Australia\", her mother Natalie said in a statement published by AusCycling. \"Paige meant everything to us. Her kindness, her determination and her warmth touched our family every single day,\" Mrs Greco said. Greco, who had cerebral palsy, started out as a track-and-field athlete before turning to cycling in 2018. Throughout her career, she won several World Championship titles and World Cup medals. At the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games she broke the record for the women's C1–3 3,000m individual pursuit, a track event where cyclists race head-to-head on opposite sides of the track. She went on to win bronze medals in the women's C1-3 road race and time trial at the Games. Greco sat out of selection rounds for last year's Games held in Paris because of health issues, but returned to elite competition this year, The Guardian reported. In August, she won another bronze medal at the para-cycling World Championships in Belgium, this time for the C3 road race event. Tributes poured in from various corners of Australia's sporting community following news of Greco's death. AusCycling's chief executive officer Marne Fechner called her an \"extraordinary athlete who achieved outstanding accomplishments at the highest levels of [the] sport\". \"Much more than that, she touched the lives of everyone around her with her positive spirit and courageous outlook,\" Fechner said. Paralympics Australia's chief executive officer Cameron Murray said \"Paige's achievements on the international stage were exceptional, but it was her kindness, her quiet determination and the way she uplifted people around her that will stay with us all\". \"She had a rare ability to make people feel included and supported, and her influence will no doubt leave a lasting impression on so many,\" he said."}

Over.\" Through heavy static, barely audible answers crackle over from a crew member, who gradually lists the ship's insurance details, flag state and last port of call – Suez, Egypt. \"I think this ship will go up to Russia and get oil,\" says Swedish investigator, Jonatan Tholin. This is the front line of Europe's uneasy standoff with Russia's so-called \"shadow fleet\"; a term that commonly refers to hundreds of tankers used to bypass a price cap on Russian oil exports. After the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, many Western countries imposed sanctions on Russian energy, which Moscow is accused of dodging by shipping oil on aged tankers often with obscure ownership or insurance. Some \"shadow\" ships are even suspected of undersea sabotage, illicit drone launches or \"spoofing\" their location data. Out on the waves, where freedom of navigation is a golden rule, the ability and appetite of coastal countries to intervene is limited, even though the risk they face is escalating. As the BBC has learned, a growing network of \"shadow\" ships are sailing without a valid national flag, which can render vessels stateless and without proper insurance. That is a troubling trend, given many are practically \"floating rust buckets\", says senior maritime intelligence analyst at Windward AI, Michelle Wiese Bockmann.  If there is an accident, like a billion-dollar oil spill, \"good luck with trying to find somebody responsible to pick up any cost\". Driven by record sanctions and tighter enforcement, the number of falsely flagged ships globally has more than doubled this year to over 450, most of them tankers, according to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) database. The BBC has been tracking one ship that appears to have sailed without a valid flag. The head of Estonia's navy, Commodore Ivo Värk, says they have seen dozens of such passing vessels this year whereas they used to see just one or two. The rise is alarming, he tells me, as we talk in his office overlooking the Gulf of Finland, a narrow gateway to the major Russian oil terminals of Ust-Luga and Primorsk. What's more, he suggests, it's brazen: \"There's no secret made about it.\" We spot the tanker Unity on the MarineTraffic app, the day we board an Estonian (British-built) Minehunter that is also used in Nato's Baltic Sentry patrols to protect critical infrastructure. Journeying east, Unity is over 100 miles away but sailing in our direction. The BBC has investigated its history and it offers an illuminating insight into the enigmatic life of a shadow ship. Tracking data shows that Unity has passed through the English Channel four times in the last twelve months, including journeys between Russian ports and India; a key oil customer that has not signed up to the price cap. Originally known as Ocean Explorer, the tanker was built in 2009 and flew the flag of Singapore for more than a decade. Back in 2019, it was named in a UN report for alleged involvement in a ship-to-ship transfer with a vessel that had been sanctioned for its role in transporting fuel to North Korea -which is among other countries also charged with utilising elusive shadow ships. By late 2021, the vessel – which that year operated under the name Ocean Vela – took the flag of the Marshall Islands but was struck from that list in 2024, a registry spokesperson told us, because the ship's then-operator and beneficial owning company had been sanctioned by the UK. The tanker appears to have had three further names since 2021 (Beks Swan, March and Unity) and three further flags (Panama, Russia and Gambia) but always retains a unique IMO number. In August, ship broadcasting data shows Unity claimed the flag of Lesotho which was designated as \"false\". Lesotho is a small, landlocked African enclave kingdom that, according to the IMO, does not have an official registry. The BBC has tried to contact Unity's listed owner, a Dubai-registered company calledFMTC Ship Charter LLC, but our emails and our calls went unanswered. The beneficial owners of 60% of shadow fleet vessels remain essentially unknown, according to maritime intelligence company Windward AI. Opaque ownership structures – and frequent name or flag changes – have become a signature trait of the shadow fleet as a means of avoiding detection. Purged from reputable registries and having circled the drain of poor-quality alternatives, some ships are now at a point \"where they just don't even bother at all\", says Michelle Wiese Bockmann. Unity's most recent journey saw it sail through the North Sea in late October before entering the Baltic and passing countries including Sweden and Estonia - the point at which we spotted it. By 6 November, it was anchored outside the Russian port of Ust-Luga where it remains at the time of publication. The tanker was added to the UK and EU's ever-growing list of sanctioned vessels earlier this year but, like so many others, continues to do business despite other difficulties. Back in January, it reportedly sheltered in the English Channel after suffering a mechanical failure during a storm. The following August it was reportedlydetainedat a Russian port due to technical issues and unpaid wages. Unity is just one of hundreds of vessels subject toUK and EU service and port bansas both London and Brussels try to increase pressure on the Kremlin. Nevertheless, Russian revenues from crude and oil product sales were $13.1bn (£9.95bn) in October alone, according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA) - although this was down by $2.3bn when compared with the same month a year ago. Analysis by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Airfindsthat \"shadow\" tankers, either sanctioned or suspected, account for 62% of shipped Russian crude oil exports, while China and India are by far the biggest customers for crude, followed by Turkey and the European Union itself. While politicianstalk of toughening action, navy and coastguard officers point out that a country's power to act fades the further you go out to sea. The right of innocent passage remains a cornerstone of maritime law, but stateless vessels technically are not entitled to it. Countries such as France, Finland and Estonia have detained ships, and they can do so where a crime is suspected, however such drastic controls remain a relatively rare event. \"There's a complexity associated with it,\" argues Commodore Ivo Värk. \"With the Russian presence next to our borders, the risk of escalation is too high to do it on a regular basis.\" The Estonians speak from experience. When they attempted to intercept a flagless tanker in May, Russia briefly deployed a fighter jet and has \"constantly\" had about two naval vessels in the Gulf of Finland since, says Commodore Värk. The fear of escalation sits alongside broader concerns of commercial retaliation if a more aggressive approach were to be taken. \"Every day in the Baltic, there's suspicious activity,\" a Nato official told the BBC, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Nevertheless, the official added, \"we don't want to be cowboys and jumping on ships. The act of monitoring ships is a deterrent in itself\". \"Freedom of navigation is the lifeblood of all of our economies.\" Back on the bridge of the Swedish coastguard ship, the radio call with the sanctioned tanker has wrapped up. \"Thank you for your co-operation,\" says the officer as the vessel carries on towards Russia. The exchange lasted just over five minutes. \"You need to see it in a larger perspective,\" says investigator Jonatan Tholin when I suggest these measures appear less than muscular: \"This information can be used in our maritime surveillance.\" But as Europe steps up checks and watches the waves, Windward's Michelle Wiese Bockmann spies something else: \"You can literally see the international rules-based order crumbling through the sanctions-circumventing tactics of these vessels.\" There is a lot at stake for the environment and on security, she says, and meanwhile \"the dark fleet is getting darker\". The BBC approached Russia's embassy in London for comment. In response, a spokesman said that the West's \"anti-Russian sanctions\" were \"illegitimate\" and \"undermine established principles of global commerce\". \"Labelling ships used to export Russian oil as 'shadow fleet' is discriminatory and misleading,\" the embassy said, and instances of invalid flags were typically down to \"easily resolved\" issues such as administrative delays. It was sanctioning countries, the spokesperson said, that had \"heightened\" the risks by \"forcing shipowners and operators to navigate an increasingly fragmented and restrictive regulatory landscape\".

Here are some tips for coping with low temperatures. Babies and young children under five are more at risk in cold weather. While outside, the NHS advises thatbabies and children should wear several layers of clothes to keep warm, including a hat and mittens to stop heat loss. In the car, for safety reasons, you should keep thick jumpers and coats to a minimum, so there is not too much padding between your child and the car seat straps. If necessary, you can lay a blanket on top of your child once they are safely strapped in. Remove any hats, gloves and extra layers when you come back inside. NHS guidance says babies do not need hot rooms at night - a room temperature of between 16-20C (61-68F) is ideal. Overheating is one of the potential causes ofsudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). A sleepsuit and either a sleeping bag or a sheet and/or blanket should be fine. If you're using a sleeping bag and feel like your baby is cold, you should add an extra layer of clothing - but not extra blankets. If you are using sheets and/or blankets rather than a sleeping bag, you should use lightweight cellular blankets. Avoid thick, fleecy or padded blankets. Cases offluandnorovirus- the winter vomiting bug - typically rise at this time of year, andCovidis still around too. When it is cold outside, people tend to spend more time indoors, where it can be easier to catch an infection. For example, coughs and sneezes in an enclosed space with little or no ventilation (windows closed, doors shut) can quickly spread illnesses from person to person. Opening windows where possible and practising good hygiene - using and then binning a tissue for coughs and sneezes and washing your hands - can help prevent this. Those who are eligible forthe Covid winter booster jab can get it until 31 January 2026. Some groups can also get afree flu vaccine. Anyone who does not qualify for an NHS vaccine can pay to have either or both jabs privately from a local pharmacy. Like humans, animals can be at risk of hypothermia if they become too cold. Veterinary charity PDSAadvises giving dogs and cats extra blankets for their beds over the winter months. Raised beds can keep older dogs away from draughts, while cats may like high-up dens. The charity also recommends extra playtime for pets to make sure they keep active if they are spending less time outside. Indoor toys can help. Consider keeping cats inside overnight and provide an indoor litter tray. A sudden drop in temperature can also have a big impact on outside pets, such as rabbits and guinea pigs. They should be given extra bedding for warmth and, if possible, moved to a more sheltered space or even brought inside. But you should make sure they have enough indoor space to exercise safely. Dogs still need walks during cold weather. Usually, their fur will keep them warm. Butthe RSPCA advises buying a winter coat or jumperfor sick or elderly dogs, or those with thinner fur. Walk your dog during the day if you can, or consider using LED collars or hi-vis leads if you have to go out in the dark. Be cautious when letting dogs off the lead in the snow, and supervise them closely as hazards may be hidden. Frozen water may not bear their weight. If you can, take shorter, more frequent walks rather than one long daily hike. If your dog gets wet, make sure you dry them off with a towel as soon as you get home and check their paws for salt, grit, dirt or snow. Drying clothes on radiators is a common practice in the winter. But it can mean turning on heating in parts of the home you are not using. It may also risk making your home damp, whichcan cause mould. One option is to use a dehumidifier, which takes water out of the air. Some have laundry settings and can be run for several hours next to wet clothes on a drying rack. The financial journalist Martin Lewis haspreviously pointed out on his BBC podcastthat running a dehumidifier is generally \"far, far cheaper\" than putting on the heating in a room. Many drivers waking up to freezing temperatures have to de-ice their cars. But motorists are warned not to use boiling water from a kettle - hot water can crack the glass and the water will only freeze again on the screen or on the ground. Instead, the AA recommends turning on the engine - ensuring the wipers are off to avoid damage - and directing warm air to the windscreen. You should also turn on your rear windscreen heater, and use air-con if you have it to ensure your windows don't fog up. The next step is to clear any snow with a soft brush, before using a scraper and liquid de-icer. Portable heaters can be an alternative to switching on your central heating, but they can pose a serious fire hazard if not used carefully. Firefighters and safety managers from the Electrical Safety First charity say you should place your heater on a flat surface to ensure it will not fall over. It should be at least 3ft (1m) away from anything flammable. You should not let curtains, clothes, blankets, duvets or armchairs lean against it. You should not use your heater to dry your washing, or leave it unattended for long periods of time, or overnight. Experts also warn against plugging heaters into extension leads, as this could cause a fire. Leaving electric blankets or heated throws on for too long can also be dangerous, so use the timer function. You should not use any kind of electric blanket at all if any of the heating wires are visible, there is damage to the power cord or control unit, or it gives off a smell when switched on. Using gas heaters also carries the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning, so you should ensure you have a working carbon monoxide alarm in the same room."}
