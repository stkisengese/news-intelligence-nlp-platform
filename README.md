# NLP-enriched News Intelligence Platform
A Python-based NLP platform for scraping, analyzing, and enriching news articles with entity detection, topic classification, sentiment analysis, and scandal detection. Designed to help analysts extract actionable insights from large volumes of news data.

## 📰 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build an advanced platform for News Intelligence. It connects to a news data source and uses various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to enrich the articles.

Key functionalities include:
1. **Entity Detection:** Identifying organizations (ORG) using spaCy.
2. **Topic Classification:** Classifying articles into categories (e.g., Tech, Business) using a custom-trained model.
3. **Sentiment Analysis:** Determining article sentiment (Positive/Negative/Neutral) using a pre-trained NLTK model.
4. **Scandal Detection:** Flagging potential environmental disaster risks by calculating the semantic distance between article sentences and defined keywords using embeddings.

## Topic Classification Model

The topic classification model is a multi-class classifier that categorizes news articles into one of five topics: Tech, Sport, Business, Entertainment, or Politics.

### Model Architecture

The model is a Logistic Regression classifier trained on a TF-IDF representation of the preprocessed text data. The TF-IDF vectorizer is configured to use a maximum of 5000 features.

### Dataset

The model was trained and evaluated on the BBC News dataset, which is split into training and test sets. The dataset is located in the `data` directory.

### Performance

The model achieves an accuracy of over 95% on the test set. The following table shows the precision, recall, and F1-score for each class:

| Category      | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|---------------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Tech          | 0.98      | 0.97   | 0.98     |
| Sport         | 0.99      | 0.99   | 0.99     |
| Business      | 0.96      | 0.97   | 0.96     |
| Entertainment | 0.98      | 0.98   | 0.98     |
| Politics      | 0.94      | 0.94   | 0.94     |
| **Weighted Avg**  | **0.97**      | **0.97**   | **0.97**     |

### Learning Curves

The learning curves for the model are shown below. The plot shows that the model does not overfit and that the training and cross-validation scores converge.

## Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis is performed using NLTK's VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner), a pre-trained model optimized for news and social media text.

### Methodology

VADER is effective without extensive preprocessing because it considers punctuation (e.g., "!") and capitalization (e.g., "GREAT") in its sentiment calculations. The `sentiment_analysis.py` module combines the article's headline and body to get a holistic view of its sentiment.

The sentiment is classified based on the `compound` score returned by VADER:
- **Positive:** `compound score >= 0.05`
- **Neutral:** `compound score > -0.05` and `compound score < 0.05`
- **Negative:** `compound score <= -0.05`

## Scandal Detection

Scandal detection is implemented to identify articles that report on environmental disasters linked to specific companies. This system uses semantic similarity to connect organizations with ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) risk-related keywords.

### Methodology

The process involves the following steps:
1.  **Keyword Definition**: A predefined list of keywords and phrases related to environmental disasters (e.g., "oil spill," "deforestation," "emissions scandal") is maintained.
2.  **Entity-Sentence Extraction**: For each article, the system extracts sentences that contain the names of organizations identified by the NER module.
3.  **Embedding Generation**: The predefined disaster keywords and the extracted entity-sentences are converted into high-dimensional vectors using a sentence-transformer model.
4.  **Similarity Calculation**: The cosine similarity is computed between the keyword embeddings and the sentence embeddings. A high similarity score indicates a potential link between a company and a disaster event.
5.  **Scandal Scoring**: The similarity scores are aggregated to produce a final "scandal score" for the article. This score reflects the likelihood that the article is reporting on an environmental scandal.

### Embedding Model

The system uses the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` sentence-transformer model. This model is chosen for its efficiency and strong performance on semantic similarity tasks. It maps sentences and paragraphs to a 384-dimensional dense vector space and is ideal for clustering or semantic search.

### Similarity Metric

**Cosine Similarity** is used to measure the semantic distance between the disaster keywords and the article sentences. This metric is well-suited for high-dimensional spaces and effectively captures the contextual closeness of the texts, regardless of their length.

### Keyword Selection

The disaster keywords were carefully selected to be specific and unambiguous to minimize false positives. The list includes terms that are strongly associated with environmental incidents and corporate malfeasance. The keywords are regularly reviewed and updated to ensure relevance.

## Source Analysis

The `source_analysis.py` module is an analytics component designed to generate high-level insights from the entire collection of enriched news articles. After the main NLP pipeline has processed the articles and produced the `enhanced_news.csv` dataset, this module aggregates the data to reveal temporal patterns, entity trends, and topic distributions.

The module produces a series of visualizations, which are saved in the `results/` directory. These plots provide a macroscopic view of the news source's coverage and focus over time.

### Generated Visualizations and Insights

1.  **Sentiment Counts Per Day** (`sentiment_per_day.png`):
    -   **Description**: This grouped bar chart displays the total number of positive and negative articles published each day.
    -   **Insight**: The news source maintains a consistently positive editorial stance, but Nov 17 may indicate a response to breaking negative news (e.g., political scandal, market downturn).

2.  **Top 20 Most Mentioned Companies** (`top_companies.png`):
    -   **Description**: A horizontal bar chart that ranks the top 20 most frequently mentioned organizations across all articles.
    -   **Insight**: Coverage is heavily skewed toward political figures and tech giants. The presence of “AI” as #4 indicates rising thematic focus on artificial intelligence.

3.  **Overall Topic Distribution** (`topic_distribution.png`):
    -   **Description**: The news source prioritizes business and sports, followed by politics. The low tech percentage despite high AI mentions suggests tech topics are embedded within business or politics stories, not classified separately. 
    -   **Insight**: This provides a snapshot of the news source's primary areas of focus, revealing the proportion of coverage dedicated to each topic.

4.  **Proportion of Topics Per Day** (`topics_per_day.png`):
    -   **Description**: A stacked bar chart illustrating how the distribution of topics changes on a daily basis.
    -   **Insight**:     Nov 17’s political surge correlates with peak negative sentiment and unique company diversity — suggesting a major political story drove broader coverage.
    Business remains the anchor topic, while tech and entertainment show moderate variability.

5.  **Number of Articles Published Per Day** (`articles_per_day.png`):
    -   **Description**: A line chart that tracks the total volume of articles published each day.
    -   **Insight**:     Publication volume follows a typical weekly pattern: high start (Mon/Tue), dip midweek, plateau late week, drop on Sat/Sun.
    No correlation between volume and sentiment — even on low-volume days, sentiment ratios remain similar.

6.  **Number of Unique Companies Mentioned Per Day** (`companies_per_day.png`):
    -   **Description**: A line chart displaying the count of distinct companies mentioned in articles each day.
    -   **Insight**: Nov 17’s surge in unique companies coincides with its peak in negative sentiment — possibly indicating broader investigative reporting or coverage of multiple entities involved in a major event.

7.  **Average Sentiment for Top Companies** (`sentiment_per_company.png`):
    -   **Description**: A horizontal bar chart illustrating the average sentiment score for the top N most mentioned companies.
    -   **Insight**:     “AI” is portrayed extremely positively — likely due to innovation narratives.
    “Hamas” is framed negatively, consistent with geopolitical reporting.
    “Instagram”’s negative score may reflect coverage of controversies (e.g., privacy, mental health).
